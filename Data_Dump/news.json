        "text": "India's Goods and Services Tax collections grew 8.9% to Rs 1.87 lakh crore in October, on account of festive season. The October collection witness six month high after a muted growth in monthly collections in recent months.\n\nThe September particularly had the lowest growth at 6.5% since the pandemic outbreak. Experts see this single digit growth \"a cooling off period\".\n\n\"Recent GST collections indicate a potential slowdown in consumer spending in India, which surged in the previous fiscal year. The single-digit growth signals a cooling-off period,\" said Saurabh Agarwal, a tax partner at EY India.\n\nThe collections made in this month on account of festive season, particularly the performance of the automobile sector, will be crucial in determining the short-term trend. While the festive season is expected to boost collections, the overall outlook for the near future remains cautious, Agarwal underlined.\n\nThe October number, however, continues to maintain Rs 1.7 lakh crore mark for the eighth consecutive month, according to the provisional data released by GST department on Friday.\n\nIn the second quarter of the ongoing fiscal, the average monthly GST receipts slowed to Rs 1.77 lakh crore, down from Rs 1.86 lakh crore in the first quarter of the fiscal.",

        "text": "Mumbai: India's ambulance sector is seeing an upgrade with several start-ups and the state government not just working to address the deficit but also upgrading it by launching advanced ambulances.\n\nFor instance, Maharashtra\u2019s hinterland is set to get a key medical upgrade with the state government partnering with Sumeet-SSG\u2014a joint venture between Pune-based Sumeet Group Enterprises\u2019s and Spanish emergency transport provider SSG Matrix\u2014to deploy a fleet of 1,756 advanced ambulances.\n\nMaharashtra is just one example and the country's ambulance sector is seeing a shift towards organised ambulance players and also upgrades in the quality of ambulance service with key start-ups entering the segment.\n\nThe joint venture\u2014with 51% investment from Sumeet-SSG and 49% from the Maharashtra government\u2014will begin the roll out to implement its \u2018Maharashtra Emergency Medical Services\u2019 (MEMS) 108 ambulance project before the end of 2024 and complete it by the middle of next year.\n\nAlso read | Promoting e-ambulance: Heavy industries and health ministries to meet next week\n\n108 ambulance project\n\n\u201cThe fleet deployment is likely to be completed by mid-2025,\" Summit Salunke, vice chairman, Sumeet Group Enterprises, said.\n\nIndia\u2019s ambulance services sector has been largely unorganised, however, it is steadily growing. The Indian ambulance market is projected to grow at a 5.1% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) over the 2024-2028 period, according to a report by consultancy Primus Partners.\n\nHowever, the report noted that the industry still lacks specialised care services. Of the 17,495 ambulances that are operational currently, only 3,441 are Advanced Life Support (ALS) units. These units have advanced equipment for critical care of patients, like cardiac monitors and ventilators. Basic Life Support (BLS) units make up a large part of the existing fleets, and focus on immediate care like cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR).\n\nThe segment has seen the entry of more organised players in recent years.\n\nRed.Health\n\nHyderabad-based start-up Red.Health, which started in 2016, has partnered with over 100 hospitals, including leading chains like Apollo and Fortis. The company provides its ambulance services, along with managing the hospital\u2019s emergency call centres, in over 20 cities in India.\n\nRed.Health has over 200 ALS units in its fleet of 400 ambulances, Prabhdeep Singh, the company\u2019s CEO and founder told Mint. In May, the company raised $20 million in its series B funding. The capital is being used to expand its fleet as well as focus on advancing their technology and improving their response times. Red.Health has a lot of takers in hospitals as well as individual patients. \u201cMore and more patients and hospitals are realising that unorganised operators are leading to a lot of issues,\" Singh said. \u201cSo the independent or the unorganised operators are getting blacklisted,\" he added.\n\nAnother Hyderabad-based start-up TEN, started in 2022, works as an ambulance aggregator. It has nearly 450 small-scale ambulance operators on its platform and partners with over 25 hospitals in 6 cities.\n\nAs an aggregator, the firm is aiming to standardise services and address operational issues like slow response times but profitability remains a concern.\n\nTEN ambulance aggregator\n\n\u201cWe are burning money right now,\" Kishore Manepalli, CEO and founder of TEN, told Mint. However, the company is in advanced talks for a second round of funding. In 2023, the start-up secured \u20b91.5 crore in its angel funding round. Manepalli said the company is looking at turning profitable in the next 12-18 months.\n\nAlso read | Healthcare for all: India could lead by shaping the future of AI and biotech\n\nSingh of Red.Health said the company is operationally profitable. \u201cWe are moving towards Ebitda profitability,\" he said. \u201cThe mission is to service the patients for nearly free and subsidise it by hospital partnerships\". Ebitda is earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization.\n\nSalunke did not respond to the profitability question and said: \u201cIt\u2019s a fixed service fee model billed to the government.\"",

        "text": "JOKO ANWAR had a bleak childhood growing up in a slum in North Sumatra in Indonesia. \u201cI was worried I might get kidnapped by Wewe Gombel,\" he says, referring to a female ghost in Javanese mythology known for abducting children. But Mr Anwar\u2019s childhood tribulations helped him cultivate a career as a director of horror films. His breakthrough came in 2017 with \u201cPengabdi Setan\" (\u201cSatan\u2019s Slaves\"), about a family haunted by the death of their mother. His most recent blockbuster \u201cSiksa Kubur\" (\u201cGrave Torture\"), about two siblings whose parents are killed in a suicide-bombing, was released in April. And a recent Netflix series, \u201cJoko Anwar\u2019s Nightmares and Daydreams\", released in June, became the first Indonesian series to make the top ten shows in America.\n\nMr Anwar\u2019s work is part of a broader trend. The number of Indonesian horror movies produced in a year has surged from fewer than five in the 1990s to over 40 by 2018. After a brief decline during covid-19, the industry has picked up; 50 horror films were produced in 2023 (see chart). One of these, \u201cKKN di Desa Penari\"\u2014based on a viral thread on X, about a purportedly real experience of students in a spooky village\u2014became the highest-grossing film in the country, taking $25m at the box office and selling 10m tickets since its release in 2022. That year, nine of the 15 best-selling Indonesian films were horror.\n\nWhy is Indonesia such a horror-movie powerhouse? It is partly down to the country\u2019s rich folklore. \u201cWe live very close to these things in our daily lives,\" says Ekky Imanjaya, a film specialist at Binus University in Jakarta, the capital. Parents often use ghost stories to make children behave.\n\nMeanwhile, the roots of the recent horror boom can be traced back to the 1970s and 1980s. During the so-called New Order regime of the dictator Suharto (who was in power from 1967 to 1998) film-makers churned out lurid exploitation films. Under the scrutiny of censors, horror films during this period usually had an \u201cideological dimension\", says Thomas Barker of the Australian National University. A typical storyline involves a woman who turns into a vengeful spirit, until she is tamed by a pious Muslim man: a popular trope for the Muslim-majority country.\n\nFilm production almost died out in the 1990s during a recession, but it came back in the 2000s. A new generation of film-makers emerged, partly inspired by Japanese and Thai horror. The rise of streaming in the past decade or so has helped usher in the new era, too. Horror fans overly familiar with the usual tropes and Christian themes in Western films enjoy Indonesia\u2019s alternative motifs and Islam-based storylines, says David Gregory of Severin Films, an American distribution firm.\n\nSome Indonesians reckon the local elements of its horror might be too impenetrable for foreigners. Satrya Wibawa, a cultural attach\u00e9 at the Indonesian embassy in Singapore, cites the pocong undead who jump around because their bodies are tied up as part of local burial customs: will they really scare Western viewers? Mr Anwar is more hopeful. He points to the recent success of South Korean cinema as a \u201cperfect example\" of how films could be \u201caccessible for a global audience\" while retaining their country\u2019s identity.",

However, a special one-hour Muhurat Trading session will be held this evening to celebrate the start of the new Hindu calendar year, Samvat 2081.\n\nScheduled from 6:00 p.m. to 7:00 p.m. IST, this symbolic trading session is seen as a gesture for good fortune and prosperity. Investors, traders, and institutions participate in ceremonial trades during this period, with shares bought during this session traditionally considered auspicious, as many believe it brings blessings for wealth and success in the coming year.\n\nMandar Bhojane, Equity Research Analyst, Choice Broking has come out with a Muhurat Trading Pick - State Bank of India (SBIN). Let's look at its technical.\n\nCurrent Price: \u20b9 820 Technical Outlook: Potential Bullish Opportunity State Bank of India (SBIN) is showcasing a compelling setup on the daily chart as it forms a symmetrical triangle pattern supported by significant volume, suggesting a potential bullish reversal. The stock is consolidating above a rising trend line, acting as a critical support level, and is currently supported around the 200-day EMA\u2014both technical factors that reinforce the probability of an upward movement.

India's largest passenger car manufacturer reported the feat hours before the special one-hour Muhurat Trading session scheduled between 6:00-7:10 pm on the bourses.\n\nShares of Maruti Suzuki India will likely be in focus during the Muhurat Trading session after the auto major reported the highest-ever sales in the month under review. The ongoing festival season and deep discounts offered by various automakers in India have invariably helped automotive dealers sell more cars in October.\n\nMaruti Suzuki India's October sales Maruti Suzuki India's total domestic passenger vehicle sales were 1,59,591 units last month, compared with 1,68,047 units in the year-ago month, logging a five-per cent decline YoY. The sales of mini-segment cars, comprising Alto and S-Presso, declined to 10,687 units from 14,568 units in October 2023.\n\nThe sales of compact cars, including Baleno, Celerio, Dzire, Ignis, Swift, Tour S and WagonR, declined to 65,948 units over 80,662 units in the year-ago month. Utility vehicles, comprising Brezza, Grand Vitara, Ertiga and XL6, clocked sales of 70,644 units last month compared to 59,147 units earlier.\n\nSales of the van Eeco were 11,653 units last month, up from 12,975 units the same month last year, while those of the light commercial vehicle Super Carry stood at 3,539 units, up from 3,894 units earlier. Maruti Suzuki India's exports in October stood at 33,168 units, over 21,951 units in the same month last year.\n\nMeanwhile, Maruti Suzuki India recently reached a significant milestone, with its Manesar facility crossing the 1 crore cumulative production mark. The Manesar plant achieved this feat in 18 years, making it the fastest among Suzuki's global automobile manufacturing facilities to reach the 1 crore production milestone.\n\nThe facility, which commenced operations in October 2006, is spread over 600 acres and manufactures a range of models, including Brezza, Ertiga, XL6, Ciaz, Dzire, Wagon R, S-Presso, and Celerio. These vehicles serve domestic and international markets, with exports reaching regions such as Latin America, the Middle East, Africa, and neighbouring Asian countries.\n\nSince its inception, Maruti Suzuki has produced over 3.1 crore vehicles, reinforcing its leadership in the Indian automotive industry. Maruti Suzuki India Limited also started the export of its acclaimed 'Made-in-India' SUV, the Fronx. Shares of Maruti Suzuki India last settled 1.59 per cent lower at \u20b911,080.60 apiece on the BSE.\n\nAlso Read: Maruti Suzuki Swift Blitz Edition launched in India with enhanced features for festive season\n\nMaruti Suzuki Q2 Results Maruti Suzuki India reported a 17 per cent YoY fall in its net profit to \u20b93,069 crore for the second quarter of FY25. The company's revenue remained flat amid a decline in domestic sales volumes and a slowdown in demand. The auto major's operating performance for the quarter ended September 2024 also weakened, with its margin witnessing contraction.\n\nNet profit for the quarter declined due to a provision of \u20b9837.6 crore resulting from the withdrawal of the indexation benefit and change in the tax rate on long-term capital gains on debt mutual funds as per the Finance Act 2024.",

        "text": "Precious metals continued their upward momentum in October, marking a third consecutive month of gains, with gold and silver rising 4.21% and 4.56%, respectively. This surge has been largely driven by heightened geo-political tensions, fueling ongoing demand for these safe-haven assets.\n\nThe monthly returns could have been even higher if not for a sharp correction during the last trading session of October, with gold and silver falling up to 3%. This decline was influenced by robust US economic data, which heightened expectations that the US central bank may adopt a more cautious stance regarding rate cuts in the coming months.\n\nApart from the rising tensions in the Middle East, the political uncertainty in the US is also supporting gold prices, as the possibility of another Trump presidency has heightened expectations for expansionary fiscal policies and increased tariffs. This scenario is prompting investors to turn to gold as a safeguard against long-term inflation risks.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, US spot gold prices surged from $2,656 per ounce to $2,749 in October, reaching a record high of $2,790 per ounce. As a result, bullion is on track for its best annual performance since 1979, with year-to-date gains already at an impressive 33.30%.\n\nOn the Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX), gold prices rose from \u20b975,535 to \u20b978,430 per 10 grams over the month, reaching a fresh record high of \u20b979,775 on Thursday, October 31. Reports indicate gold demand will likely surge this week amid festival purchases for Diwali and Dhanteras, although volumes might be tempered due to record-high prices.\n\nJateen Trivedi, VP and Research Analyst in Commodity and Currency at LKP Securities, noted, \u201cCurrently trading around \u20b979,400 on MCX, gold faces resistance at \u20b979,600, while on Comex, it encounters a hurdle near $2,790. The upcoming U.S. election next week is expected to play a decisive role in gold\u2019s trend, with market participants watching its outcome closely for further direction.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Spot US silver prices in October rose significantly, reaching $31.24 from $32.66 per kilo and marking a 12-year peak at $34.86. In the domestic market, silver on the MCX surpassed \u20b91 lakh per kilo for the first time, hitting \u20b91,00,810 on October 22.\n\nWith gold prices at record highs, retail buyers are increasingly turning to silver as a more affordable alternative. This rising interest in silver is driven not only by its lower cost compared to gold but also by growing demand from the electric vehicle (EV) sector and photovoltaic applications, which is expected to sustain global demand for silver in the medium to long term.\n\nMeanwhile, investors are awaiting the release of US payroll data today, which could offer additional insights into the Federal Reserve's interest rate outlook.\n\nRecent economic data released on Thursday indicated that the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index for September rose to 2.7%, marking the highest monthly increase since April, as per recent media reports.\n\nAdditionally, jobless claims declined, signaling ongoing strength in the labor market. Despite concerns about inflation, the latest data showed that both income and spending remained robust during the month.\n\nGold to maintain bull run Despite the record-breaking performance so far this year, gold prices are poised to continue their bull run, as analysts believe that the rising U.S. fiscal deficit is likely to support the yellow metal moving forward. The growing fiscal pressure, particularly if either political party secures sweeping control, could result in a significantly higher deficit.\n\nDomestic brokerage firm Elara Capital noted that hat the 2024 US elections are shaping up to be one of the closest in modern times, and regardless of the outcome, the US fiscal outlook is expected to worsen.\n\nThe growing fiscal pressure, particularly if either political party secures sweeping control, could result in a significantly higher deficit. Amid this, the brokerage forecasts a 10% upside for gold over the next 12 months, highlighting contributing factors such as rising interest payments on US debt, escalating fiscal pressures, and the impact of increasing USD yields.\n\nICICI Bank Global Markets said, \u201cGeo-political tensions could continue to keep up safe haven buying for gold prices. In particular, the Israel-Iran conflict will continue to work as a support. We would also argue that the prospect of a return of Trump as US President and the resumption of the trade-war could create uncertainty about the global growth outlook could also work as an additional bullish catalyst for the yellow metal.\u201d\n\n\"If Trump returns as President, there could be further upside potential in gold prices than our forecasts currently assume. We see gold prices trading in the USD 2650/oz to USD 2750/oz range in 1H2025 and moving to the USD 2750/oz to USD 2850/oz range over 2H2025,\" ICICI Bank Global Markets further added.\n\nMeanwhile, UBS expects a target of $2,900/oz for gold by the end of the third quarter in 2025. \"A Trump win could push gold more quickly toward our target, while a Harris win could see it drop back to $2,600-2,700/oz, said UBS.",

        "text": "Multibagger stocks: Given the high market volatility in the recent times and varying views from market experts on how Samvat 2081 will unfold amidst geopolitical challenges and the global economic landscape, Samvat 2080 has proven to be quite favourable for the Indian Stock Market. Even though it was a year filled with elections and all the excitement one could witness on D-Street in response to numerous influences, Indian Stock Market has ended Samvat 2080 in double digits.\n\nOver the course of the year, the Nifty 50 has increased by 26.87%, despite experiencing significant selling pressure in October, resulting in a decline of around -6.22% over the past month amidst considerable fluctuations and volatility.\n\nThe Nifty 500 has surpassed the Nifty 50 over the past year, showing an increase of 35.05%. In Samvat 2080, 75 stocks from the Nifty 500 have doubled the investments of their shareholders. Hence, this year has been remarkable for the Indian stock markets, leading to a significant number of multibagger stocks that have enriched their investors within the last year.\n\nOn the technical front, Rajesh Bhosale, Equity Technical and Derivative Analyst at Angel One highlighted that, October marked a challenging month for bulls, erasing gains accumulated over the past two months, with the Nifty 500 dropping more than 6%, one of the steepest monthly declines in recent times, which has impacted the monthly chart's structure.\n\n\u201cGoing ahead, we may not have a similar smooth run, and markets may find themselves in difficult times. For now, 23,000\u201323,200 seems to be a daunting task. Only beyond that there may be some hope for bulls, whereas a break below 22,500 could drag prices towards 21,700 the 200dma.

        "text": "Muhurat Trading LIVE Updates, November 1, 2024: Indian stock markets are starting Samvat 2081 with a special Muhurat Trading session on November 1.\u00a0 In the last trading session of\u00a0 Samvat 2080, the Benchmark equity indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 had ended in negative territory for the second consecutive session on Thursday.\u00a0 The BSE, National Stock Exchange (NSE), and Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) will conduct an hour-long Muhurat trading session from 6-7 pm on Friday, November 1, 2024, instead of the regular trading session, to mark the beginning of Samvat 2081.\u00a0 On Thursday, the BSE Sensex shed 553.12 points, or 0.69 per cent, to settle at 79,389.06. Mirroring the Sensex, the Nifty50 ended lower by 135.50 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 24,205.35.\u00a0 With this, Sensex posted a gain of 22.31 per cent in Samvat 2080, whereas for Nifty50 it stood at 26.40 per cent.\u00a0 The last trading session of the outgoing Samvat had ended in favor of the bears as 34 out of 50 constituent stocks ended in the red, dragged down by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys, and Asian Paints, with losses extending up to 3.61 per cent. Conversely, gains were led by Cipla, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Labs, ONGC, and Mahindra & Mahindra, which were among the 16 stocks that ended in the green, with gains extending up to 9.50 per cent on Thursday.\u00a0 Meanwhile, small-cap stocks outperformed in the broader indices, as the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended higher by 1.15 per cent.\u00a0 IT stocks faced the worst hit among sectors, as the Nifty IT index ended lower by 3.03 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems and Mphasis.\u00a0 Other sectoral indices also ended lower, barring Media, Pharma, and Healthcare, which settled higher by over 1 per cent each on Thursday.\u00a0 Global markets started what could be a momentous month warily, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of US jobs data, with volatility in British government bonds after this week's budget adding to the sense of nervousness.\u00a0 Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is in focus before Tuesday's US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Thursday, is set to contribute further volatility to share markets already digesting earnings season.\u00a0 Europe's broad STOXX 600 managed to find its footing on Friday, rising 0.6 per cent, though it was still set for its worst week in nearly two months. Those gains were balanced by falling Asian stocks, particularly in Japan, to leave MSCI's world share index flat.\u00a0\u00a0 US markets, which fell on Thursday, should see some relief later in the day. Nasdaq futures are up 0.4 per cent thanks to a 5.3 per cent jump in Amazon after the bell.\u00a0\u00a0 Before then is the payrolls report at 1230 GMT. A Reuters survey of economists predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply on disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, which will also make it harder for investors to parse.\u00a0 Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have firmly given up on a larger move they had once seen as possible on data showing the U.S. economy remains healthy.\u00a0 Beyond that, things depend in part on the outcome of Tuesday's election. Polls point to a knife-edge race, though investors have been putting on trades betting Republican candidate Donald Trump could be president again\u00a0 The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 per cent, just off the near four month high of 4.339 per cent touched earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The week's biggest moves in government bond markets have been in Britain, where yields on government bonds, known as gilts, rose for a third day with the benchmark 10 year yield last at 4.496 per cent, up 26 bps on the week, which would be its biggest such move in a year.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil extended its rally to a third day, with Brent prices up 2.7 per cent to $74.77 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. Gold prices climbed 0.2 per cent to $2,750 an ounce.\u00a0\u00a0 (With Inputs from Retuers.)",

        "text": "New Delhi: Apple on Friday logged an estimated $3.75-4 billion in India revenue in July-September, its highest quarterly sales in the country and the 10th straight three-month period when the iPhone maker's quarterly revenue has been higher year-on-year in the world's fifth-largest economy.\n\nIn July-September of 2023, Apple's India revenue was estimated at $2.5 billion. The US-based company's record India revenue was driven by robust sales of both iPhones and iPad tablets. With sales of its Mac lineup of desktops and laptops also not lagging far behind, Apple is now tipped to lead India\u2019s consumer gadgets market in terms of revenue share.\n\nExcited by the enthusiasm: Tim Cook\n\n\u201cWe continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we\u2019re seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. We also opened two new stores during the quarter, and we can\u2019t wait to bring four new stores to customers in India,\" chief executive Tim Cook said at Apple's headquarters at Cupertino, California, in a conference call with investors.\n\nThe company declared its quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon US time, which is early Friday morning in India.\n\nThis revenue, to be sure, is based on sale of Apple\u2019s products and services in India\u2014and does not take into account exports of its devices from India\u2019s assembly lines.\n\nApple\u2019s July-September revenue was also its all-time quarterly high.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that the company saw double-digit sales growth for iPads, which raked in $7 billion in revenue during the September quarter. Apple\u2019s global quarterly revenue was $94.9 billion, of which $70 billion came from hardware sales. Two-thirds of this was contributed by iPhones alone, which brought in $46.7 billion, helped by early demand for its latest smartphone - iPhone 16.\n\nApple\u2019s India performance remained resilient on the back of discretionary upgrades to its smartphone lineup, which continues to remain aspirational for most buyers in the country. Analysts said that thanks to instant discounts on strategic models, exchange offers, the rise of an organized used-devices market, and easily available credit through financing schemes, the average cost of ownership of an iPhone in India has considerably dipped to become comparable to other smartphones.\n\nAll of this has helped Apple scale a quarterly revenue of $3.75-4 billion, as per estimates by three market research firms collated by Mint. Each of the researchers requested anonymity since their final quarterly reports were yet to be published.\n\nIn September this year, Mint reported that Apple was on track to see double-digit shipment growth of iPhones. Navkendar Singh, associate vice-president at market researcher IDC India, said, \u201cThe demand for iPhones is likely to sustain at least for the time being, and a strong double-digit growth is further expected this year as well. There\u2019s plenty of appetite in the market for the time being, which gives Apple even more room to announce consecutive quarters of record revenue going forward as well.\"\n\nAn industry note by fellow market researcher Counterpoint further underlined that Apple had a strong festive season as well, leading it to becoming the second-highest grossing brand for smartphones during the September quarter, just behind Samsung.\n\nThe Indian consumer gadgets market was estimated to be worth $62 billion in FY24\u2014with Samsung holding 18.5% market share by revenue, ahead of Apple\u2019s 15.3%, based on estimates from three market research firms that Mint spoke with.\n\nBy FY25-end, the scales are expected to tip in Apple\u2019s favour: while the market could be worth $70 billion by March 2025, Apple is projected to hold 21.4% of this market versus Samsung\u2019s 19.3%. The increasing demand for premium devices is helping both the brands, but Apple\u2019s sustained growth and ~2.5x the average selling price per gadget over Samsung\u2019s is helping the US brand more than the Korean one.\n\nApart from iPhone sales, Apple is also seeing an uptick in enterprise PC (personal computer) deals, and the rise of iPads as a category based on the need for larger infotainment displays. In August this year, Ashweej Aithal, research analyst at Canalys, told Mint that with the pricing leverage between premium Windows and Apple PCs lower than ever before, Apple\u2019s market base for Macs and iPads is higher than ever before.\n\niPhones are expected to generate nearly $11 billion in sales for Apple India this fiscal year, with Mac, iPad, wearables and services likely to bring in another $4-6 billion and setting the company on road to a new annual revenue milestone in the country, the consensus estimates of the researchers cited above said.\n\nHowever, while India continues to be one of the most important sales and strategic geographies for Apple, the company received a weak response on Wall Street even after it beat most analyst estimates for the quarter. Bloomberg reported that while Apple's September quarter was stable, weak growth guidance for the December quarter given during the investor call on Thursday\u2014driven particularly by poor demand for iPhones in China\u2014left investors underwhelmed. As a result, the Apple stock closed 1.8% down Thursday at $225.91, and fell another 1.9% to $221.71 in after-hours trading.",

        "text": "NSE\n\nIndia's Adani Power Jharkhand Ltd (APJL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Power, has stopped half of its power supply to Bangladesh because of outstanding bills of $846 million, according to a local media report on Friday.Data from Power Grid Bangladesh PLC showed the Adani plant reduced supply on Thursday night, The Daily Star newspaper said. Bangladesh reported a shortfall of more than 1,600 megawatts (MW) on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday as the 1,496 MW plant is now producing 700 MW from a single unit, the newspaper reported.Earlier, the Adani company wrote to the power secretary asking the Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB) to clear its outstanding dues by October 30.The letter, dated October 27, said that if the bills are not paid, the company shall be constrained to take remedial action under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) by suspending the power supply on October 31.The company said that the PDB has neither provided a letter of credit (LC) for an amount of $170.03 million from Bangladesh Krishi Bank nor cleared the outstanding amount of $846 million.The newspaper quoted a PDB official as saying that they had cleared a portion of previous dues earlier, but since July, Adani has been charging more than in previous months. He said the PDB has been paying around $ 18 million weekly, while the charge is more than $22 million.\"This is why the due payments increased again,\" he said, adding that they had submitted last week's payment to Krishi Bank as well, but due to a dollar shortage, the bank failed to open a letter of credit against the payment.About the additional payment, he said, when the PDB raised a question on the coal pricing in February last year, they signed a supplementary deal that obliged Adani to quote coal prices less than the rates charged by the other coal-fired power plants.After the tenure of the one-year supplementary deal, Adani has again started charging as per the PPA, the report said. According to the PPA, coal prices are calculated based on the average price of two coal indices -- the Indonesian coal index and the Australian Newcastle index -- which increases the prices.Adani said that during the period of suspension of supply, the company reserves its right to recover capacity payments under Section 13.2(1) of the PPA. Adani has been pressing the interim government to pay the dues since they took charge after the ouster of then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina.An interim government led by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus was installed in Bangladesh on August 8. Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, also wrote to Chief Adviser Yunus.",

        "text": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed an overhaul of the framework governing high-value listed debt entities (HVLDE) in a bid to reduce the compliance burden. The regulator has suggested relaxing the threshold for identification of HVLDEs, introducing a sunset clause, and providing exemptions to entities not covered under the Companies Act.\u00a0At present, entities with an outstanding value of non-convertible listed debt (NCDs) securities of more than Rs 500 crore are categorised as HVLDE. Such entities must adhere to a stricter corporate governance code, including requirements around board composition, specified numbers of board meetings, submission of compliance certificates, implementation of risk management plans, formation of specialised committees, and stricter rules for related party transactions (RPTs).\u00a0Sebi has now proposed increasing the threshold to Rs 1,000 crore. The move could benefit over 166 entities, which are currently tagged as HVLDE but have outstanding listed NCDs of less than Rs 1,000 crore.\u00a0Furthermore, the regulator has proposed a special carve-out in regulations for entities that have only listed debt but no listed equity. Of the 812 listed debt entities, only 264 have both equity and debt, while 538 are pure debt entities.\u00a0Sebi stated that the corporate governance norms have been approached from an equity perspective and may not be fully relevant from the perspective of debt-listed entities. Hence, a special chapter in regulation is proposed specifically for only-debt entities.\u00a0Another key change proposed by Sebi is the introduction of a sunset clause for the applicability of corporate governance norms. At present, no period is specified for HVLDEs to continue complying with these provisions once the outstanding amount falls below the specified threshold. As a result, entities must continue to comply even if they no longer qualify as HVLDE.\u00a0Sebi has proposed that governance norms remain applicable until debt or net worth falls below the specified threshold for three consecutive financial years.\u00a0On the other hand, if the value of outstanding listed debt securities increases or reaches the specified threshold, entities will have to ensure compliance within two quarters.\u00a0The regulator has also proposed relaxations for HVLDEs that are not companies under the Companies Act. This would include government bodies such as NABARD, SIDBI, NHB, and EXIM Bank\u2014which are governed by specific Acts passed by Parliament rather than the Companies Act\u2014so they would not have to adhere to the stricter governance code.\u00a0Sebi has proposed adjustments to disclosure requirements for RPTs to better protect the interests of debenture holders.\u00a0Currently, regulations mandate prior approval from shareholders for material RPTs. However, in cases where debt-listed entities are wholly or substantially owned by one or a few related parties, obtaining approval from non-related party shareholders becomes impractical.\u00a0To address this issue, the regulator has suggested that issuers declare upfront in offer documents the amount (as a percentage of the issue size) of RPTs planned over the tenor of non-convertible securities. Further, credit rating agencies would be mandated to monitor the utilisation of proceeds.\u00a0Additionally, Sebi has proposed relaxations to the rules governing the constitution of various committees, such as stakeholder relationships, risk management, and nomination and remuneration. It has also suggested introducing the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for HVLDEs on a voluntary basis.",

        "text": "Muhurat Trading 2024: As the festival of lights unfolds, India's stock markets celebrate with Muhurat Trading, a symbolic one-hour session marked by optimism and tradition. Since its inception in 1957 at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and later embraced by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 1992, this unique trading window has become an annual fixture on Diwali. This year\u2019s Muhurat Trading session will take place on Friday, November 1, 2024, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, marking the beginning of the new Hindu calendar year, Samvat 2081.\n\nThe Significance of Muhurat Trading Muhurat Trading is more than just a market event; it\u2019s a blend of tradition and market participation. Diwali\u2019s auspicious day brings investors, traders, and institutions together in a brief, ceremonial trading session, believed to bring prosperity and good fortune for the new year. Buying stocks during this time is seen as a ritual, where shares symbolize a fresh start and blessings for financial success. While the session tends to be quieter in terms of trading volume, the optimism and sentiment surrounding it make it a significant occasion in the Indian financial landscape.\n\nNifty and Bank Nifty Technical View As Muhurat Trading approaches, analysts are closely watching key indices. Nifty closed recently at 24,205.35, down 0.56%, while Nifty Bank settled at 51,475.35, down 0.64%. Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, highlighted critical support and resistance levels for both indices. If Nifty maintains its position above 24,300, short-term buying opportunities could emerge despite the current bearish outlook. Nifty faces resistance at 24,400 and 24,500, while Nifty Bank\u2019s support lies at 51,100 with resistance at 52,000. The rise in India\u2019s VIX volatility index above 15 suggests that traders should brace for potential market swings during this session.\n\nMuhurat Trading Technical Strategy Given the one-hour duration, strategy and discipline are paramount. Mehra advises focusing on specific support and resistance zones, with the Volume Profile from the first 15 minutes as a tool for identifying reliable levels. Combining techniques like Fibonacci retracements and volume trends with technical indicators, such as RSI and MACD, can help pinpoint effective entry and exit points. Trading smaller trends through patterns like flags, triangles, or inverse head and shoulders, supplemented by candlestick formations like doji or engulfing patterns, can provide clearer setups during this session. Given the brief timeframe, strict risk management and stop-losses are essential, while large, aggressive positions are best avoided to minimize potential downsides.\n\nAlso Read | Muhurat Trading 2024: HDFC Securities lists THESE 4 technical stock picks\n\nA Long-Term Outlook for the Indian Markets Looking beyond Muhurat Trading, analysts have a positive outlook for Indian markets over the next year. Aditya Agarwal, Head of Derivatives and Technical Analysis at Sanctum Wealth, expressed optimism for medium- to long-term performance, expecting mid-double-digit returns over the coming 12 months. However, in the short term, Agarwal warns of potential volatility and a 4-5 percent correction, advising investors to stay cautious. He favors large-cap stocks over mid- and small-caps, noting that market heavyweights are more likely to outperform through 2024.",

Ltd's (IOC) Canadian subsidiary IndOil Montney Ltd, with dividend inflows to continue, said two people in the know of the developments.\n\nIndianOil through its wholly-owned affiliate IndOil Montney Ltd, Canada had in 2014, bought 10% stake in shale gas assets in Canada\u2019s British Columbia province and the country's West Coast from Malaysia\u2019s Petronas in a $1.1 billion transaction.\n\n\u201cThere would not be any impact on the operations. Dividends are coming from the stakes held by IndOil Montney. That will continue. We don\u2019t see any hindrance there,\u201d said one of the two persons mentioned above.\n\nThe statement comes as the diplomatic ties between the two countries hit a new low with both countries expelling each other's diplomats and India recalling its high commissioner from Canada last month. These moves were triggered as the Canadian police disclosed details about the alleged link between the \"agents\" of the Indian government and the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, an alleged Khalistani leader and a Canadian citizen. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist who was gunned down on Canadian soil in June 2023. He was a Canadian citizen but a designated terrorist in India.\n\nAlso read | IOC, HPCL and BPCL consortium in talks with Equinor to secure LPG contract The India-Canada tussle The relationship has soured over the past one year and India has accused Canada of resorting to \"vote-bank politics'.\n\nAnother person in the know of the development also said that business ties between the two countries are unlikely to be hit despite the diplomatic tussle.\n\nIn 2014, IndOil Montney had signed transaction agreements with Progress Energy Canada Ltd (Progress Energy Canada), PETRONAS Carigali Canada BV (PCC BV), wholly owned affiliates of Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) for the acquisition of a 10% interest in Progress Energy Canada\u2019s LNG-destined natural gas reserves in northeast British Columbia and in the proposed Pacific NorthWest LNG Ltd (PNW LNG) export facility on Canada\u2019s West Coast.\n\nLNG supply The initial plan was that as part of the transaction, IndianOil shall also offtake 1.2 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per annum (mrpa), which represents 10% of the LNG facility\u2019s production, for at least 20 years.\n\nAlso read | Indian Oil signs second long-term LNG deal with France's TotalEnergies IndianOil's annual report for FY24 said: \"The company has entered into Master Guarantee Agreement, on behalf of its subsidiaries viz. Indoil Global B.V. and Indoil Montney Ltd. for all of its payments and performance obligations under the various Project Agreements entered by the subsidiaries with PETRONAS Carigali Canada B.V. and Progress Energy Canada Ltd. (now renamed as Petronas Energy Canada Ltd.).\"\n\nIt noted that the board of directors sanctioned a total amount of Canadian $3,924.76 million.\n\nAlthough efforts have been underway to source LNG from Canada, supplies have not materialized so far, in the absence of adequate infrastructure, such as ships or a pipeline, said the second person mentioned above.\n\nAlso read | OPEC further trims oil-demand outlook On Wednesday, Mint reported that the bilateral trade between India and Canada which climbed steadily over the last few years largely has held up this fiscal year despite a diplomatic standoff. Trade between the two nations rose from $5.65 billion in FY21 to $8.40 billion in FY24.",

        "text": "Muhurat Trading LIVE Updates, November 1, 2024: Indian stock markets are starting Samvat 2081 with a special Muhurat Trading session on November 1.\u00a0 In the last trading session of\u00a0 Samvat 2080, the Benchmark equity indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 had ended in negative territory for the second consecutive session on Thursday.\u00a0 The BSE, National Stock Exchange (NSE), and Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) will conduct an hour-long Muhurat trading session from 6-7 pm on Friday, November 1, 2024, instead of the regular trading session, to mark the beginning of Samvat 2081.\u00a0 On Thursday, the BSE Sensex shed 553.12 points, or 0.69 per cent, to settle at 79,389.06. Mirroring the Sensex, the Nifty50 ended lower by 135.50 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 24,205.35.\u00a0 With this, Sensex posted a gain of 22.31 per cent in Samvat 2080, whereas for Nifty50 it stood at 26.40 per cent.\u00a0 The last trading session of the outgoing Samvat had ended in favor of the bears as 34 out of 50 constituent stocks ended in the red, dragged down by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys, and Asian Paints, with losses extending up to 3.61 per cent. Conversely, gains were led by Cipla, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Labs, ONGC, and Mahindra & Mahindra, which were among the 16 stocks that ended in the green, with gains extending up to 9.50 per cent on Thursday.\u00a0 Meanwhile, small-cap stocks outperformed in the broader indices, as the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended higher by 1.15 per cent.\u00a0 IT stocks faced the worst hit among sectors, as the Nifty IT index ended lower by 3.03 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems and Mphasis.\u00a0 Other sectoral indices also ended lower, barring Media, Pharma, and Healthcare, which settled higher by over 1 per cent each on Thursday.\u00a0 Global markets started what could be a momentous month warily, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of US jobs data, with volatility in British government bonds after this week's budget adding to the sense of nervousness.\u00a0 Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is in focus before Tuesday's US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Thursday, is set to contribute further volatility to share markets already digesting earnings season.\u00a0 Europe's broad STOXX 600 managed to find its footing on Friday, rising 0.6 per cent, though it was still set for its worst week in nearly two months. Those gains were balanced by falling Asian stocks, particularly in Japan, to leave MSCI's world share index flat.\u00a0\u00a0 US markets, which fell on Thursday, should see some relief later in the day. Nasdaq futures are up 0.4 per cent thanks to a 5.3 per cent jump in Amazon after the bell.\u00a0\u00a0 Before then is the payrolls report at 1230 GMT. A Reuters survey of economists predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply on disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, which will also make it harder for investors to parse.\u00a0 Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have firmly given up on a larger move they had once seen as possible on data showing the U.S. economy remains healthy.\u00a0 Beyond that, things depend in part on the outcome of Tuesday's election. Polls point to a knife-edge race, though investors have been putting on trades betting Republican candidate Donald Trump could be president again\u00a0 The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 per cent, just off the near four month high of 4.339 per cent touched earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The week's biggest moves in government bond markets have been in Britain, where yields on government bonds, known as gilts, rose for a third day with the benchmark 10 year yield last at 4.496 per cent, up 26 bps on the week, which would be its biggest such move in a year.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil extended its rally to a third day, with Brent prices up 2.7 per cent to $74.77 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. Gold prices climbed 0.2 per cent to $2,750 an ounce.\u00a0\u00a0 (With Inputs from Retuers.)",

During the month, the industry experienced a notable increase in demand due to concentration of various festivals and auspicious days in a single month, leading to record sales levels. This growth was also driven by favorable macroeconomic conditions, increased minimum support price (MSP), and an above-average monsoon season, which resulted in higher water reservoir levels. These improved trading conditions are likely to see continuing sales growth in the later part of the fiscal year as well.The companys export tumbled 51.9% to 271 units in October 2024 as against 563 units posted in October 2023.Further, the companys construction equipment business division sold 635 machines in October 2024, registering a decline of 3.6% from 659 machines sold in October 2023.Moving forward, we expect to see increased growth momentum in the later part of the fiscal year, driven by government initiatives and upcoming changes in emission norms, the tractor maker added.Escorts Kubota is primarily engaged in the business of manufacturing of agricultural tractors, engines for agricultural tractors, construction, earth moving and material handling equipment, round and flat tubes, heating elements, double acting hydraulics.

Mirroring the Sensex, the Nifty50 ended lower by 135.50 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 24,205.35.\u00a0 With this, Sensex posted a gain of 22.31 per cent in Samvat 2080, whereas for Nifty50 it stood at 26.40 per cent.\u00a0 The last trading session of the outgoing Samvat had ended in favor of the bears as 34 out of 50 constituent stocks ended in the red, dragged down by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys, and Asian Paints, with losses extending up to 3.61 per cent. Conversely, gains were led by Cipla, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Labs, ONGC, and Mahindra & Mahindra, which were among the 16 stocks that ended in the green, with gains extending up to 9.50 per cent on Thursday.\u00a0 Meanwhile, small-cap stocks outperformed in the broader indices, as the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended higher by 1.15 per cent.\u00a0 IT stocks faced the worst hit among sectors, as the Nifty IT index ended lower by 3.03 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems and Mphasis.\u00a0 Other sectoral indices also ended lower, barring Media, Pharma, and Healthcare, which settled higher by over 1 per cent each on Thursday.\u00a0 Global markets started what could be a momentous month warily, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of US jobs data, with volatility in British government bonds after this week's budget adding to the sense of nervousness.\u00a0 Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is in focus before Tuesday's US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Thursday, is set to contribute further volatility to share markets already digesting earnings season.\u00a0 Europe's broad STOXX 600 managed to find its footing on Friday, rising 0.6 per cent, though it was still set for its worst week in nearly two months. Those gains were balanced by falling Asian stocks, particularly in Japan, to leave MSCI's world share index flat.\u00a0\u00a0 US markets, which fell on Thursday, should see some relief later in the day. Nasdaq futures are up 0.4 per cent thanks to a 5.3 per cent jump in Amazon after the bell.\u00a0\u00a0 Before then is the payrolls report at 1230 GMT. A Reuters survey of economists predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply on disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, which will also make it harder for investors to parse.\u00a0 Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have firmly given up on a larger move they had once seen as possible on data showing the U.S. economy remains healthy.\u00a0 Beyond that, things depend in part on the outcome of Tuesday's election. Polls point to a knife-edge race, though investors have been putting on trades betting Republican candidate Donald Trump could be president again\u00a0 The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 per cent, just off the near four month high of 4.339 per cent touched earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The week's biggest moves in government bond markets have been in Britain, where yields on government bonds, known as gilts, rose for a third day with the benchmark 10 year yield last at 4.496 per cent, up 26 bps on the week, which would be its biggest such move in a year.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil extended its rally to a third day, with Brent prices up 2.7 per cent to $74.77 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. Gold prices climbed 0.2 per cent to $2,750 an ounce.\u00a0\u00a0 (With Inputs from Retuers.)",

        "text": "NSE\n\nSamir Arora of Helios Capital believes that the relentless selling for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in the month of October could be due to possible volatility ahead of the outcome of the US Presidential Elections on November 5.Foreign Portfolio Investors sold as much as \u20b91.17 lakh crore in the cash market in the month of October, which is the highest ever in a month, even surpassing the \u20b965,000 crore that FPIs sold in March 2020, which was the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.Multiple theories floated around about FPIs looking to sell the Indian markets to tactically move to China, a sentiment echoed by Emerging Market strategists like Adrian Mowat, but Samir Arora thinks otherwise.\"The desperation with which these guys (FPIs) seem to be selling in October, if it was to go into China, that would make less sense. I mean, it would make more sense if Chinese market was itself doing very well this month, so that there is absolute desperation. Oh, my God, I am underweight China. And it goes up every day and it is bugging me. No, China is actually down,\" Arora told CNBC-TV18 during the Diwali Mahurat trading session.Arora further said that going back to the US looks a little more logical than going into China right now because he anticipates a Donald Trump victory in the US elections, which many analysts on the street believe that a Trump win will be positive for the US equity markets overall.\"I think that the pace (of FPI selling) will moderate one day, and when it moderates our market will react positively and enough to make the start of next year. Okay, I don't know it's not happening right now because the selling is not stopping, but it still doesn't look to me that you need to go from India to go to us because most of the guys who are into India are emerging market funds, Asian funds, global emerging market fund,\" he added.",

The unemployment rate held at 4.1% and hourly earnings remained firm, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 figures released Friday.BLS said the hurricanes likely affected payrolls in some industries, but said it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the monthly change in national employment, hours or earnings estimates. They noted the collection rate for the survey of businesses that informs those statistics was \u201cwell below average.\u201d BLS also said there was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate.Economists had warned the Boeing Co. strike as well as the two powerful hurricanes \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit the Southeast in late September and early October would more negatively impact the payrolls number than the survey that informs the unemployment rate. Payrolls estimates varied widely as a result, from a decline of 10,000 to a gain of 180,000.The jobs report is the last major data point on the US economy before next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting and the November 5 presidential election, a race where the issue has consistently ranked top of mind for voters. Other figures this week showed the economy grew at a strong pace in the third quarter, fueled by solid consumer spending, while inflation picked up in September.With a number of caveats to glean through, economists and policymakers will likely take little signal from the report, instead looking to other data that show the labor market is cooling gradually.Stock futures remained higher and Treasury yields dropped following the report.",

        "text": "Samvat 2081: With the onset of the auspicious Vikram Samvat 2081, investors are looking to tap into high growth opportunities for wealth creation and asset management. For the new Hindu financial year, D-Street experts widely suggest investors to build a diversified portfolio to seize maximum returns on various trading instruments.\n\nAnalysts say that as markets embrace Samvat 2081, investors have a remarkable chance to reshape their financial journeys amid a dynamic and evolving market. This period, steeped in tradition and the promise of prosperity, is an ideal time to reassess investment strategies that align with India\u2019s high-growth potential in transformative sectors such as green energy, technology, and financial services.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, diversification is essential. \u201cMutual funds, particularly thematic funds in infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy, offer a balanced, straightforward way for investors at any stage to benefit from long-term growth trends. Index funds like Nifty 50 and Sensex also provide an accessible and low-cost route to capitalize on India\u2019s top-performing companies, especially suited for passive investors aiming for consistent returns, \u201d said Vivek Goel, Joint MD, Tailwind Financial Services.\n\nFor the high-net-worth investors, customized strategies through Portfolio Management Services (PMS) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) unlock advanced opportunities, particularly in private equity and venture capital, where emerging trends can be harnessed effectively.\n\nInvesting in blue-chip stocks remains a popular, reliable choice, balancing stability and growth. Leading sectors such as banking, FMCG, and consumer goods consistently show resilience, while growth stocks in renewable energy, fintech, and healthcare offer exciting potential for those exploring mid-cap and small-cap options.\n\nWith steady interest rates, fixed-income securities and debt mutual funds offer stability and regular income, while investments in gold and silver remain cherished for their cultural significance and role as hedges against inflation and volatility. Sovereign Gold Bonds and Gold ETFs also provide tax-efficient, accessible ways to hold precious metals.\n\nReal estate endures as a valued investment, particularly through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), allowing investors to benefit from India\u2019s growing commercial real estate sector without the complexities of ownership.\n\nFinally, India\u2019s green energy transformation holds great potential. Companies in solar, wind, and EV infrastructure are well-positioned to thrive, as are ESG-focused funds and new-age investments in startups and digital assets for investors with a higher risk tolerance.\n\n\u201cThis Samvat, let\u2019s align our financial goals with India\u2019s growth trajectory, seeking out opportunities that not only promise prosperity but also contribute to a more sustainable future,\u201d added Goel.\n\nFor enhancing one's portfolio, experts say that mutual funds are the best option to help you meet your financial goals.\n\n\u201cWith Diwali around the corner, it\u2019s an ideal time to reflect on your financial goals and consider investing in Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). Particularly in small-cap and mid-cap mutual funds, SIPs can help you build significant wealth over the long term if you\u2019re prepared to embrace some level of risk, \u201d said Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital.\n\nStarting early in one's career gives you the advantage of time. By consistently allocating 20-25 per cent of your monthly income into SIPs, one can tap into the growth potential of small and mid-cap funds, which historically offer a CAGR of 15-18 per cent. Over a span of 10, 15, or even 20 years, this disciplined approach can lead to substantial wealth accumulation. Although small-cap investments are higher in risk, they present immense potential for long-term wealth creation.\n\nThe small-cap and mid-cap sectors, while inherently riskier, are well-suited for long-term investors looking to generate significant returns. These funds are expected to outperform others in the coming decade, making them an attractive option for those with a higher risk tolerance. They can serve as powerful vehicles for achieving long-term financial goals, such as retirement or other major life milestones.\n\n\u201cHowever, while focusing on high-growth small-cap funds, it\u2019s wise to maintain a diversified portfolio that includes large-cap and mid-cap funds. This strategy can help balance your risk profile, ensuring stability and minimizing potential losses during market downturns. When selecting mutual funds, prioritize those with a proven track record of consistent performance over 5-10 years and look for options with low expense ratios to maximize your returns,\u201d said Aggarwal.",

It gives me immense satisfaction that the operating metrics have improved, with loss ratio as well as combined ratio being lower than the same period last year with profit after tax showing a 5x increase. The loss ratio of Health line of business has witnessed some improvement but the loss ratio in Motor line of business has increased due to lack of price increase in the Motor Third Party line of business. Net catastrophic losses in H1 FY25 were around Rs 248 crore. Solvency ratio at 1.81 times remains comfortably above the IRDAI mandated control level solvency margin. The competitive intensity in traditional lines remains high and the company will focus on other segments and channels to drive growth.

        "text": "Muhurat Trading LIVE Updates, November 1, 2024: Indian stock markets are starting Samvat 2081 with a special Muhurat Trading session on November 1.\u00a0 In the last trading session of\u00a0 Samvat 2080, the Benchmark equity indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 had ended in negative territory for the second consecutive session on Thursday.\u00a0 The BSE, National Stock Exchange (NSE), and Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) will conduct an hour-long Muhurat trading session from 6-7 pm on Friday, November 1, 2024, instead of the regular trading session, to mark the beginning of Samvat 2081.\u00a0 On Thursday, the BSE Sensex shed 553.12 points, or 0.69 per cent, to settle at 79,389.06. Mirroring the Sensex, the Nifty50 ended lower by 135.50 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 24,205.35.\u00a0 With this, Sensex posted a gain of 22.31 per cent in Samvat 2080, whereas for Nifty50 it stood at 26.40 per cent.\u00a0 The last trading session of the outgoing Samvat had ended in favor of the bears as 34 out of 50 constituent stocks ended in the red, dragged down by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys, and Asian Paints, with losses extending up to 3.61 per cent. Conversely, gains were led by Cipla, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Labs, ONGC, and Mahindra & Mahindra, which were among the 16 stocks that ended in the green, with gains extending up to 9.50 per cent on Thursday.\u00a0 Meanwhile, small-cap stocks outperformed in the broader indices, as the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended higher by 1.15 per cent.\u00a0 IT stocks faced the worst hit among sectors, as the Nifty IT index ended lower by 3.03 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems and Mphasis.\u00a0 Other sectoral indices also ended lower, barring Media, Pharma, and Healthcare, which settled higher by over 1 per cent each on Thursday.\u00a0 Global markets started what could be a momentous month warily, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of US jobs data, with volatility in British government bonds after this week's budget adding to the sense of nervousness.\u00a0 Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is in focus before Tuesday's US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Thursday, is set to contribute further volatility to share markets already digesting earnings season.\u00a0 Europe's broad STOXX 600 managed to find its footing on Friday, rising 0.6 per cent, though it was still set for its worst week in nearly two months. Those gains were balanced by falling Asian stocks, particularly in Japan, to leave MSCI's world share index flat.\u00a0\u00a0 US markets, which fell on Thursday, should see some relief later in the day. Nasdaq futures are up 0.4 per cent thanks to a 5.3 per cent jump in Amazon after the bell.\u00a0\u00a0 Before then is the payrolls report at 1230 GMT. A Reuters survey of economists predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply on disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, which will also make it harder for investors to parse.\u00a0 Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have firmly given up on a larger move they had once seen as possible on data showing the U.S. economy remains healthy.\u00a0 Beyond that, things depend in part on the outcome of Tuesday's election. Polls point to a knife-edge race, though investors have been putting on trades betting Republican candidate Donald Trump could be president again\u00a0 The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 per cent, just off the near four month high of 4.339 per cent touched earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The week's biggest moves in government bond markets have been in Britain, where yields on government bonds, known as gilts, rose for a third day with the benchmark 10 year yield last at 4.496 per cent, up 26 bps on the week, which would be its biggest such move in a year.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil extended its rally to a third day, with Brent prices up 2.7 per cent to $74.77 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. Gold prices climbed 0.2 per cent to $2,750 an ounce.\u00a0\u00a0 (With Inputs from Retuers.)",

Mirroring the Sensex, the Nifty50 ended lower by 135.50 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 24,205.35.\u00a0 With this, Sensex posted a gain of 22.31 per cent in Samvat 2080, whereas for Nifty50 it stood at 26.40 per cent.\u00a0 The last trading session of the outgoing Samvat had ended in favor of the bears as 34 out of 50 constituent stocks ended in the red, dragged down by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys, and Asian Paints, with losses extending up to 3.61 per cent. Conversely, gains were led by Cipla, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Labs, ONGC, and Mahindra & Mahindra, which were among the 16 stocks that ended in the green, with gains extending up to 9.50 per cent on Thursday.\u00a0 Meanwhile, small-cap stocks outperformed in the broader indices, as the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended higher by 1.15 per cent.\u00a0 IT stocks faced the worst hit among sectors, as the Nifty IT index ended lower by 3.03 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems and Mphasis.\u00a0 Other sectoral indices also ended lower, barring Media, Pharma, and Healthcare, which settled higher by over 1 per cent each on Thursday.\u00a0 Global markets started what could be a momentous month warily, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of US jobs data, with volatility in British government bonds after this week's budget adding to the sense of nervousness.\u00a0 Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is in focus before Tuesday's US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Thursday, is set to contribute further volatility to share markets already digesting earnings season.\u00a0 Europe's broad STOXX 600 managed to find its footing on Friday, rising 0.6 per cent, though it was still set for its worst week in nearly two months. Those gains were balanced by falling Asian stocks, particularly in Japan, to leave MSCI's world share index flat.\u00a0\u00a0 US markets, which fell on Thursday, should see some relief later in the day. Nasdaq futures are up 0.4 per cent thanks to a 5.3 per cent jump in Amazon after the bell.\u00a0\u00a0 Before then is the payrolls report at 1230 GMT. A Reuters survey of economists predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply on disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, which will also make it harder for investors to parse.\u00a0 Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have firmly given up on a larger move they had once seen as possible on data showing the U.S. economy remains healthy.\u00a0 Beyond that, things depend in part on the outcome of Tuesday's election. Polls point to a knife-edge race, though investors have been putting on trades betting Republican candidate Donald Trump could be president again\u00a0 The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 per cent, just off the near four month high of 4.339 per cent touched earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The week's biggest moves in government bond markets have been in Britain, where yields on government bonds, known as gilts, rose for a third day with the benchmark 10 year yield last at 4.496 per cent, up 26 bps on the week, which would be its biggest such move in a year.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil extended its rally to a third day, with Brent prices up 2.7 per cent to $74.77 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. Gold prices climbed 0.2 per cent to $2,750 an ounce.\u00a0\u00a0 (With Inputs from Retuers.)",

        "text": "Investing in global equity markets can be an attractive option for Indian investors, but what are the rules for accessing these markets? What should investors keep in mind, and what risks should they consider before making the decision?In a discussion, Chintan Haria from ICICI Prudential AMC and Mohit Gang, CEO and Co-Founder of Moneyfront.in, explored the advantages, drawbacks, and options for Indian investors interested in global equities.Haria said that international investing has its appeal, especially as more investors focus on diversifying their portfolios. According to him, ICICI has long advocated for asset allocation, suggesting that a 10% to 15% investment in international markets could be beneficial. However, he added that international markets operate differently due to the involvement of various countries, each with unique economic cycles.For instance, said Haria, Japan\u2019s recent performance is an example of how different regions present unique opportunities. Haria emphasized that while global access has become easier, investors should still seek professional guidance and fully understand the process, as specific restrictions may still apply.Gang agreed with Haria\u2019s points and further stated the importance of diversification. He pointed out that while India has performed well recently, the US S&P 500 has consistently outpaced the Indian Nifty index over 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 15-year time frames. He explained that this comparison underlines the potential benefits of investing in global markets.He added that India comprises only a small segment of the global market cap, making international diversification essential for reducing risks related to domestic volatility. According to Gang, investors should aim for a diversified portfolio, allocating around 10% to 20% to international markets through direct investments or mutual funds.For the entire discussion, watch the accompanying video",

        "text": "Muhurat Trading LIVE Updates, November 1, 2024: Indian stock markets are starting Samvat 2081 with a special Muhurat Trading session on November 1.\u00a0 In the last trading session of\u00a0 Samvat 2080, the Benchmark equity indices, BSE Sensex and Nifty 50 had ended in negative territory for the second consecutive session on Thursday.\u00a0 The BSE, National Stock Exchange (NSE), and Multi Commodity Exchange (MCX) will conduct an hour-long Muhurat trading session from 6-7 pm on Friday, November 1, 2024, instead of the regular trading session, to mark the beginning of Samvat 2081.\u00a0 On Thursday, the BSE Sensex shed 553.12 points, or 0.69 per cent, to settle at 79,389.06. Mirroring the Sensex, the Nifty50 ended lower by 135.50 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 24,205.35.\u00a0 With this, Sensex posted a gain of 22.31 per cent in Samvat 2080, whereas for Nifty50 it stood at 26.40 per cent.\u00a0 The last trading session of the outgoing Samvat had ended in favor of the bears as 34 out of 50 constituent stocks ended in the red, dragged down by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys, and Asian Paints, with losses extending up to 3.61 per cent. Conversely, gains were led by Cipla, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Labs, ONGC, and Mahindra & Mahindra, which were among the 16 stocks that ended in the green, with gains extending up to 9.50 per cent on Thursday.\u00a0 Meanwhile, small-cap stocks outperformed in the broader indices, as the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended higher by 1.15 per cent.\u00a0 IT stocks faced the worst hit among sectors, as the Nifty IT index ended lower by 3.03 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems and Mphasis.\u00a0 Other sectoral indices also ended lower, barring Media, Pharma, and Healthcare, which settled higher by over 1 per cent each on Thursday.\u00a0 Global markets started what could be a momentous month warily, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of US jobs data, with volatility in British government bonds after this week's budget adding to the sense of nervousness.\u00a0 Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is in focus before Tuesday's US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Thursday, is set to contribute further volatility to share markets already digesting earnings season.\u00a0 Europe's broad STOXX 600 managed to find its footing on Friday, rising 0.6 per cent, though it was still set for its worst week in nearly two months. Those gains were balanced by falling Asian stocks, particularly in Japan, to leave MSCI's world share index flat.\u00a0\u00a0 US markets, which fell on Thursday, should see some relief later in the day. Nasdaq futures are up 0.4 per cent thanks to a 5.3 per cent jump in Amazon after the bell.\u00a0\u00a0 Before then is the payrolls report at 1230 GMT. A Reuters survey of economists predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply on disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, which will also make it harder for investors to parse.\u00a0 Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have firmly given up on a larger move they had once seen as possible on data showing the U.S. economy remains healthy.\u00a0 Beyond that, things depend in part on the outcome of Tuesday's election. Polls point to a knife-edge race, though investors have been putting on trades betting Republican candidate Donald Trump could be president again\u00a0 The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 per cent, just off the near four month high of 4.339 per cent touched earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The week's biggest moves in government bond markets have been in Britain, where yields on government bonds, known as gilts, rose for a third day with the benchmark 10 year yield last at 4.496 per cent, up 26 bps on the week, which would be its biggest such move in a year.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil extended its rally to a third day, with Brent prices up 2.7 per cent to $74.77 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. Gold prices climbed 0.2 per cent to $2,750 an ounce.\u00a0\u00a0 (With Inputs from Retuers.)",

Suri clarified that he is not setting any specific targets but expressed optimism, saying, \"As an investor, I do see the next 12 months continuing to be rewarding.\"Suri said he remains very optimistic about the market, adding, \"I still believe that before next Diwali, or even well before it, we will hit a new high.\"He noted that it's important to watch the 23,200 zone on the downside carefully, as he expects it to be a strong support level. He mentioned that the market is currently presenting good buying opportunities, and he anticipates a strong second half of the year.In the near term, the market will be more stock-specific, but he expects that industrials will lead the movement again in the second half.\"I believe that the longer-term and medium-term bullishness persists. I expect that within the next 12 months, we will challenge and break out to new highs,\" he told CNBC-TV18 during the Diwali Mahurat trading session.He further added, \"As I mentioned, there has been a pause, and we must acknowledge the significant amount of FII selling that has occurred, along with the substantial withdrawals of money from the market, thanks to the IPO funding that has come in. Additionally, it's important to recognize that the numbers are mixed. Therefore, the market needs to take a pause. This is crucial because, for a bull run to sustain, intermediate corrections, pauses, and some form of reality check are necessary.\"",

Mirroring the Sensex, the Nifty50 ended lower by 135.50 points, or 0.56 per cent, to 24,205.35.\u00a0 With this, Sensex posted a gain of 22.31 per cent in Samvat 2080, whereas for Nifty50 it stood at 26.40 per cent.\u00a0 The last trading session of the outgoing Samvat had ended in favor of the bears as 34 out of 50 constituent stocks ended in the red, dragged down by HCL Tech, Tech Mahindra, TCS, Infosys, and Asian Paints, with losses extending up to 3.61 per cent. Conversely, gains were led by Cipla, Larsen & Toubro, Dr Reddy's Labs, ONGC, and Mahindra & Mahindra, which were among the 16 stocks that ended in the green, with gains extending up to 9.50 per cent on Thursday.\u00a0 Meanwhile, small-cap stocks outperformed in the broader indices, as the Nifty Smallcap 100 index ended higher by 1.15 per cent.\u00a0 IT stocks faced the worst hit among sectors, as the Nifty IT index ended lower by 3.03 per cent, dragged down by Persistent Systems and Mphasis.\u00a0 Other sectoral indices also ended lower, barring Media, Pharma, and Healthcare, which settled higher by over 1 per cent each on Thursday.\u00a0 Global markets started what could be a momentous month warily, with shares steady and Treasury yields near four-month highs ahead of US jobs data, with volatility in British government bonds after this week's budget adding to the sense of nervousness.\u00a0 Friday's nonfarm payrolls report is in focus before Tuesday's US presidential election and the Federal Reserve's policy meeting, which concludes Thursday, is set to contribute further volatility to share markets already digesting earnings season.\u00a0 Europe's broad STOXX 600 managed to find its footing on Friday, rising 0.6 per cent, though it was still set for its worst week in nearly two months. Those gains were balanced by falling Asian stocks, particularly in Japan, to leave MSCI's world share index flat.\u00a0\u00a0 US markets, which fell on Thursday, should see some relief later in the day. Nasdaq futures are up 0.4 per cent thanks to a 5.3 per cent jump in Amazon after the bell.\u00a0\u00a0 Before then is the payrolls report at 1230 GMT. A Reuters survey of economists predicts an increase of 113,000 jobs last month, down sharply on disruptions from hurricanes and strikes by aerospace factory workers, which will also make it harder for investors to parse.\u00a0 Markets are currently near fully pricing a quarter-point rate cut next week, though have firmly given up on a larger move they had once seen as possible on data showing the U.S. economy remains healthy.\u00a0 Beyond that, things depend in part on the outcome of Tuesday's election. Polls point to a knife-edge race, though investors have been putting on trades betting Republican candidate Donald Trump could be president again\u00a0 The benchmark 10 year Treasury yield was last up 1 basis point at 4.30 per cent, just off the near four month high of 4.339 per cent touched earlier in the week.\u00a0\u00a0 The week's biggest moves in government bond markets have been in Britain, where yields on government bonds, known as gilts, rose for a third day with the benchmark 10 year yield last at 4.496 per cent, up 26 bps on the week, which would be its biggest such move in a year.\u00a0\u00a0 Oil extended its rally to a third day, with Brent prices up 2.7 per cent to $74.77 a barrel, on reports that Iran was preparing a retaliatory strike on Israel from Iraqi territory in the coming days. Gold prices climbed 0.2 per cent to $2,750 an ounce.\u00a0\u00a0 (With Inputs from Retuers.)",

The Bank of Japan maintained its benchmark interest rate at 0.25%, as expected. The Japanese yen weakened against the US dollar.U.S. stocks closed lower on Thursday, with the Dow and S&P 500 cementing their first monthly loss since April as tech stocks sold off sharply and bond yields remained elevated.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite led the gains, up roughly 2.76%.Microsoft and Meta Platforms highlighted growing artificial intelligence costs that could hit their earnings, curbing enthusiasm for megacaps that have fueled the market rally this year.

Domestic Market:The domestic equity benchmarks ended lower for the second straight session on Thursday, with Nifty50 briefly falling below 24,200, intraday. The decline was primarily triggered by selling pressure in key sectors such as IT, FMCG, and banking. Amid mixed global cues, the benchmarks opened marginally higher but turned negative immediately and extended the losses as the day progressed to end near the days low. The Nifty, however, recovered and settled above the 24,200 mark. Trading was volatile due to expiry of monthly F&O contracts.The S&P BSE Sensex, tumbled 553.12 points or 0.69% to 79,389.06.

        "text": "New Delhi: Apple on Friday logged an estimated $3.75-4 billion in India revenue in July-September, its highest quarterly sales in the country and the 10th straight three-month period when the iPhone maker's quarterly revenue has been higher year-on-year in the world's fifth-largest economy.\n\nIn July-September of 2023, Apple's India revenue was estimated at $2.5 billion. The US-based company's record India revenue was driven by robust sales of both iPhones and iPad tablets. With sales of its Mac lineup of desktops and laptops also not lagging far behind, Apple is now tipped to lead India\u2019s consumer gadgets market in terms of revenue share.\n\nExcited by the enthusiasm: Tim Cook\n\n\u201cWe continue to be excited by the enthusiasm we\u2019re seeing in India, where we set an all-time revenue record. We also opened two new stores during the quarter, and we can\u2019t wait to bring four new stores to customers in India,\" chief executive Tim Cook said at Apple's headquarters at Cupertino, California, in a conference call with investors.\n\nThe company declared its quarterly earnings Thursday afternoon US time, which is early Friday morning in India.\n\nThis revenue, to be sure, is based on sale of Apple\u2019s products and services in India\u2014and does not take into account exports of its devices from India\u2019s assembly lines.\n\nApple\u2019s July-September revenue was also its all-time quarterly high.\n\nLuca Maestri, Apple\u2019s chief financial officer, said that the company saw double-digit sales growth for iPads, which raked in $7 billion in revenue during the September quarter. Apple\u2019s global quarterly revenue was $94.9 billion, of which $70 billion came from hardware sales. Two-thirds of this was contributed by iPhones alone, which brought in $46.7 billion, helped by early demand for its latest smartphone - iPhone 16.\n\nApple\u2019s India performance remained resilient on the back of discretionary upgrades to its smartphone lineup, which continues to remain aspirational for most buyers in the country. Analysts said that thanks to instant discounts on strategic models, exchange offers, the rise of an organized used-devices market, and easily available credit through financing schemes, the average cost of ownership of an iPhone in India has considerably dipped to become comparable to other smartphones.\n\nAll of this has helped Apple scale a quarterly revenue of $3.75-4 billion, as per estimates by three market research firms collated by Mint. Each of the researchers requested anonymity since their final quarterly reports were yet to be published.\n\nIn September this year, Mint reported that Apple was on track to see double-digit shipment growth of iPhones. Navkendar Singh, associate vice-president at market researcher IDC India, said, \u201cThe demand for iPhones is likely to sustain at least for the time being, and a strong double-digit growth is further expected this year as well. There\u2019s plenty of appetite in the market for the time being, which gives Apple even more room to announce consecutive quarters of record revenue going forward as well.\"\n\nAn industry note by fellow market researcher Counterpoint further underlined that Apple had a strong festive season as well, leading it to becoming the second-highest grossing brand for smartphones during the September quarter, just behind Samsung.\n\nThe Indian consumer gadgets market was estimated to be worth $62 billion in FY24\u2014with Samsung holding 18.5% market share by revenue, ahead of Apple\u2019s 15.3%, based on estimates from three market research firms that Mint spoke with.\n\nBy FY25-end, the scales are expected to tip in Apple\u2019s favour: while the market could be worth $70 billion by March 2025, Apple is projected to hold 21.4% of this market versus Samsung\u2019s 19.3%. The increasing demand for premium devices is helping both the brands, but Apple\u2019s sustained growth and ~2.5x the average selling price per gadget over Samsung\u2019s is helping the US brand more than the Korean one.\n\nApart from iPhone sales, Apple is also seeing an uptick in enterprise PC (personal computer) deals, and the rise of iPads as a category based on the need for larger infotainment displays. In August this year, Ashweej Aithal, research analyst at Canalys, told Mint that with the pricing leverage between premium Windows and Apple PCs lower than ever before, Apple\u2019s market base for Macs and iPads is higher than ever before.\n\niPhones are expected to generate nearly $11 billion in sales for Apple India this fiscal year, with Mac, iPad, wearables and services likely to bring in another $4-6 billion and setting the company on road to a new annual revenue milestone in the country, the consensus estimates of the researchers cited above said.\n\nHowever, while India continues to be one of the most important sales and strategic geographies for Apple, the company received a weak response on Wall Street even after it beat most analyst estimates for the quarter. Bloomberg reported that while Apple's September quarter was stable, weak growth guidance for the December quarter given during the investor call on Thursday\u2014driven particularly by poor demand for iPhones in China\u2014left investors underwhelmed. As a result, the Apple stock closed 1.8% down Thursday at $225.91, and fell another 1.9% to $221.71 in after-hours trading.",

        "text": "NSE\n\nIndia's Adani Power Jharkhand Ltd (APJL), a wholly-owned subsidiary of Adani Power, has stopped half of its power supply to Bangladesh because of outstanding bills of $846 million, according to a local media report on Friday.Data from Power Grid Bangladesh PLC showed the Adani plant reduced supply on Thursday night, The Daily Star newspaper said. Bangladesh reported a shortfall of more than 1,600 megawatts (MW) on the intervening night of Thursday and Friday as the 1,496 MW plant is now producing 700 MW from a single unit, the newspaper reported.Earlier, the Adani company wrote to the power secretary asking the Bangladesh Power Development Board (PDB) to clear its outstanding dues by October 30.The letter, dated October 27, said that if the bills are not paid, the company shall be constrained to take remedial action under the Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) by suspending the power supply on October 31.The company said that the PDB has neither provided a letter of credit (LC) for an amount of $170.03 million from Bangladesh Krishi Bank nor cleared the outstanding amount of $846 million.The newspaper quoted a PDB official as saying that they had cleared a portion of previous dues earlier, but since July, Adani has been charging more than in previous months. He said the PDB has been paying around $ 18 million weekly, while the charge is more than $22 million.\"This is why the due payments increased again,\" he said, adding that they had submitted last week's payment to Krishi Bank as well, but due to a dollar shortage, the bank failed to open a letter of credit against the payment.About the additional payment, he said, when the PDB raised a question on the coal pricing in February last year, they signed a supplementary deal that obliged Adani to quote coal prices less than the rates charged by the other coal-fired power plants.After the tenure of the one-year supplementary deal, Adani has again started charging as per the PPA, the report said. According to the PPA, coal prices are calculated based on the average price of two coal indices -- the Indonesian coal index and the Australian Newcastle index -- which increases the prices.Adani said that during the period of suspension of supply, the company reserves its right to recover capacity payments under Section 13.2(1) of the PPA. Adani has been pressing the interim government to pay the dues since they took charge after the ouster of then-prime minister Sheikh Hasina.An interim government led by Nobel Laureate Professor Muhammad Yunus was installed in Bangladesh on August 8. Gautam Adani, chairman of Adani Group, also wrote to Chief Adviser Yunus.",

        "text": "The Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has proposed an overhaul of the framework governing high-value listed debt entities (HVLDE) in a bid to reduce the compliance burden. The regulator has suggested relaxing the threshold for identification of HVLDEs, introducing a sunset clause, and providing exemptions to entities not covered under the Companies Act.\u00a0At present, entities with an outstanding value of non-convertible listed debt (NCDs) securities of more than Rs 500 crore are categorised as HVLDE. Such entities must adhere to a stricter corporate governance code, including requirements around board composition, specified numbers of board meetings, submission of compliance certificates, implementation of risk management plans, formation of specialised committees, and stricter rules for related party transactions (RPTs).\u00a0Sebi has now proposed increasing the threshold to Rs 1,000 crore. The move could benefit over 166 entities, which are currently tagged as HVLDE but have outstanding listed NCDs of less than Rs 1,000 crore.\u00a0Furthermore, the regulator has proposed a special carve-out in regulations for entities that have only listed debt but no listed equity. Of the 812 listed debt entities, only 264 have both equity and debt, while 538 are pure debt entities.\u00a0Sebi stated that the corporate governance norms have been approached from an equity perspective and may not be fully relevant from the perspective of debt-listed entities. Hence, a special chapter in regulation is proposed specifically for only-debt entities.\u00a0Another key change proposed by Sebi is the introduction of a sunset clause for the applicability of corporate governance norms. At present, no period is specified for HVLDEs to continue complying with these provisions once the outstanding amount falls below the specified threshold. As a result, entities must continue to comply even if they no longer qualify as HVLDE.\u00a0Sebi has proposed that governance norms remain applicable until debt or net worth falls below the specified threshold for three consecutive financial years.\u00a0On the other hand, if the value of outstanding listed debt securities increases or reaches the specified threshold, entities will have to ensure compliance within two quarters.\u00a0The regulator has also proposed relaxations for HVLDEs that are not companies under the Companies Act. This would include government bodies such as NABARD, SIDBI, NHB, and EXIM Bank\u2014which are governed by specific Acts passed by Parliament rather than the Companies Act\u2014so they would not have to adhere to the stricter governance code.\u00a0Sebi has proposed adjustments to disclosure requirements for RPTs to better protect the interests of debenture holders.\u00a0Currently, regulations mandate prior approval from shareholders for material RPTs. However, in cases where debt-listed entities are wholly or substantially owned by one or a few related parties, obtaining approval from non-related party shareholders becomes impractical.\u00a0To address this issue, the regulator has suggested that issuers declare upfront in offer documents the amount (as a percentage of the issue size) of RPTs planned over the tenor of non-convertible securities. Further, credit rating agencies would be mandated to monitor the utilisation of proceeds.\u00a0Additionally, Sebi has proposed relaxations to the rules governing the constitution of various committees, such as stakeholder relationships, risk management, and nomination and remuneration. It has also suggested introducing the Business Responsibility and Sustainability Report for HVLDEs on a voluntary basis.",

        "text": "Muhurat Trading 2024: As the festival of lights unfolds, India's stock markets celebrate with Muhurat Trading, a symbolic one-hour session marked by optimism and tradition. Since its inception in 1957 at the Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) and later embraced by the National Stock Exchange (NSE) in 1992, this unique trading window has become an annual fixture on Diwali. This year\u2019s Muhurat Trading session will take place on Friday, November 1, 2024, from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM, marking the beginning of the new Hindu calendar year, Samvat 2081.\n\nThe Significance of Muhurat Trading Muhurat Trading is more than just a market event; it\u2019s a blend of tradition and market participation. Diwali\u2019s auspicious day brings investors, traders, and institutions together in a brief, ceremonial trading session, believed to bring prosperity and good fortune for the new year. Buying stocks during this time is seen as a ritual, where shares symbolize a fresh start and blessings for financial success. While the session tends to be quieter in terms of trading volume, the optimism and sentiment surrounding it make it a significant occasion in the Indian financial landscape.\n\nNifty and Bank Nifty Technical View As Muhurat Trading approaches, analysts are closely watching key indices. Nifty closed recently at 24,205.35, down 0.56%, while Nifty Bank settled at 51,475.35, down 0.64%. Om Mehra, Technical Analyst at SAMCO Securities, highlighted critical support and resistance levels for both indices. If Nifty maintains its position above 24,300, short-term buying opportunities could emerge despite the current bearish outlook. Nifty faces resistance at 24,400 and 24,500, while Nifty Bank\u2019s support lies at 51,100 with resistance at 52,000. The rise in India\u2019s VIX volatility index above 15 suggests that traders should brace for potential market swings during this session.\n\nMuhurat Trading Technical Strategy Given the one-hour duration, strategy and discipline are paramount. Mehra advises focusing on specific support and resistance zones, with the Volume Profile from the first 15 minutes as a tool for identifying reliable levels. Combining techniques like Fibonacci retracements and volume trends with technical indicators, such as RSI and MACD, can help pinpoint effective entry and exit points. Trading smaller trends through patterns like flags, triangles, or inverse head and shoulders, supplemented by candlestick formations like doji or engulfing patterns, can provide clearer setups during this session. Given the brief timeframe, strict risk management and stop-losses are essential, while large, aggressive positions are best avoided to minimize potential downsides.\n\nAlso Read | Muhurat Trading 2024: HDFC Securities lists THESE 4 technical stock picks\n\nA Long-Term Outlook for the Indian Markets Looking beyond Muhurat Trading, analysts have a positive outlook for Indian markets over the next year. Aditya Agarwal, Head of Derivatives and Technical Analysis at Sanctum Wealth, expressed optimism for medium- to long-term performance, expecting mid-double-digit returns over the coming 12 months. However, in the short term, Agarwal warns of potential volatility and a 4-5 percent correction, advising investors to stay cautious. He favors large-cap stocks over mid- and small-caps, noting that market heavyweights are more likely to outperform through 2024.",

        "text": "New Delhi: The diplomatic tension between India and Canada may not impact the operations of Indian oil marketing and refining major Indian Oil Corp. Ltd's (IOC) Canadian subsidiary IndOil Montney Ltd, with dividend inflows to continue, said two people in the know of the developments.\n\nIndianOil through its wholly-owned affiliate IndOil Montney Ltd, Canada had in 2014, bought 10% stake in shale gas assets in Canada\u2019s British Columbia province and the country's West Coast from Malaysia\u2019s Petronas in a $1.1 billion transaction.\n\n\u201cThere would not be any impact on the operations. Dividends are coming from the stakes held by IndOil Montney. That will continue. We don\u2019t see any hindrance there,\u201d said one of the two persons mentioned above.\n\nThe statement comes as the diplomatic ties between the two countries hit a new low with both countries expelling each other's diplomats and India recalling its high commissioner from Canada last month. These moves were triggered as the Canadian police disclosed details about the alleged link between the \"agents\" of the Indian government and the killing of Hardeep Singh Nijjar, an alleged Khalistani leader and a Canadian citizen. Nijjar was a Khalistani separatist who was gunned down on Canadian soil in June 2023. He was a Canadian citizen but a designated terrorist in India.\n\nAlso read | IOC, HPCL and BPCL consortium in talks with Equinor to secure LPG contract The India-Canada tussle The relationship has soured over the past one year and India has accused Canada of resorting to \"vote-bank politics'.\n\nAnother person in the know of the development also said that business ties between the two countries are unlikely to be hit despite the diplomatic tussle.\n\nIn 2014, IndOil Montney had signed transaction agreements with Progress Energy Canada Ltd (Progress Energy Canada), PETRONAS Carigali Canada BV (PCC BV), wholly owned affiliates of Petroliam Nasional Berhad (PETRONAS) for the acquisition of a 10% interest in Progress Energy Canada\u2019s LNG-destined natural gas reserves in northeast British Columbia and in the proposed Pacific NorthWest LNG Ltd (PNW LNG) export facility on Canada\u2019s West Coast.\n\nLNG supply The initial plan was that as part of the transaction, IndianOil shall also offtake 1.2 million tonnes of liquefied natural gas (LNG) per annum (mrpa), which represents 10% of the LNG facility\u2019s production, for at least 20 years.\n\nAlso read | Indian Oil signs second long-term LNG deal with France's TotalEnergies IndianOil's annual report for FY24 said: \"The company has entered into Master Guarantee Agreement, on behalf of its subsidiaries viz. Indoil Global B.V. and Indoil Montney Ltd. for all of its payments and performance obligations under the various Project Agreements entered by the subsidiaries with PETRONAS Carigali Canada B.V. and Progress Energy Canada Ltd. (now renamed as Petronas Energy Canada Ltd.).\"\n\nIt noted that the board of directors sanctioned a total amount of Canadian $3,924.76 million.\n\nAlthough efforts have been underway to source LNG from Canada, supplies have not materialized so far, in the absence of adequate infrastructure, such as ships or a pipeline, said the second person mentioned above.\n\nAlso read | OPEC further trims oil-demand outlook On Wednesday, Mint reported that the bilateral trade between India and Canada which climbed steadily over the last few years largely has held up this fiscal year despite a diplomatic standoff.

        "text": "Veteran investor Ramesh Damani told CNBC-TV18 that he remains positive on the digital infrastructure and pharmaceutical, or pharma, Sector, as Dalal Street entered Samvat 2081 with a strong Muhurat trading session.In an interaction with CNBC-TV18, Damani said that he plans to focus on digital public infrastructure as a key theme over the next three to four years. He also mentioned that he will closely watch developments in both DPI and the pharmaceutical sector during this period.Damani said, \"The two themes we are betting on\u2014not necessarily just from Samvat to Samvat, but over the next three to five years\u2014are digital public infrastructure and the pharmaceutical sector.\"The first theme, as Damani has previously mentioned, is digital public infrastructure. \"India has leapfrogged generations of infrastructure, moving from analog to digital\u2014from highways to PAN (Permanent Account Number) Card issuance. There are perhaps half a dozen companies, still trading at fairly modest market capitalisations\u2014not necessarily low price-to-earnings ratios, but modest market caps compared to the opportunities ahead...I certainly intend to invest in them\u2014not just for one year, but with a three-to-five-year horizon.\"Regarding the pharma space, he said, \"Some small- and mid-cap companies in this sector are developing intellectual property in areas like obesity vaccines, dengue vaccines, obesity pills, antibiotics, and neuro-antibiotics. I believe these companies present rich opportunities in this sector because, for the first time, Indian companies are producing genuine, serious intellectual property. I expect the market will begin to recognise and reward these companies over the next few months. So, wherever I have reallocated funds, I have put them into digital public infrastructure and the pharma space.\"The ace investor expects government spending to increase soon, which could lead to a recovery in the market.Damani also said that a slowdown in earnings worries him, but said that it's transitory.Meanwhile, equity benchmark indices begin Samvat 2081 on higher note on Friday, November 1, with Nifty above 24300.The Sensex gained 357.57 points or 0.45% at 79,746.63, and the Nifty was up 109.60 points or 0.45% at 24,314.90.

        "text": "Samir Arora of Helios Capital believes that the relentless selling for Foreign Portfolio Investors (FPIs) in the month of October could be due to possible volatility ahead of the outcome of the US Presidential Elections on November 5.Foreign Portfolio Investors sold as much as \u20b91.17 lakh crore in the cash market in the month of October, which is the highest ever in a month, even surpassing the \u20b965,000 crore that FPIs sold in March 2020, which was the onset of the Covid-19 pandemic.Multiple theories floated around about FPIs looking to sell the Indian markets to tactically move to China, a sentiment echoed by Emerging Market strategists like Adrian Mowat, but Samir Arora thinks otherwise.\"The desperation with which these guys (FPIs) seem to be selling in October, if it was to go into China, that would make less sense. I mean, it would make more sense if Chinese market was itself doing very well this month, so that there is absolute desperation. Oh, my God, I am underweight China. And it goes up every day and it is bugging me. No, China is actually down,\" Arora told CNBC-TV18 during the Diwali Mahurat trading session.Arora further said that going back to the US looks a little more logical than going into China right now because he anticipates a Donald Trump victory in the US elections, which many analysts on the street believe that a Trump win will be positive for the US equity markets overall.\"I think that the pace (of FPI selling) will moderate one day, and when it moderates our market will react positively and enough to make the start of next year. Okay, I don't know it's not happening right now because the selling is not stopping, but it still doesn't look to me that you need to go from India to go to us because most of the guys who are into India are emerging market funds, Asian funds, global emerging market fund,\" he added.",

The unemployment rate held at 4.1% and hourly earnings remained firm, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics\u2019 figures released Friday.BLS said the hurricanes likely affected payrolls in some industries, but said it is not possible to quantify the net effect on the monthly change in national employment, hours or earnings estimates. They noted the collection rate for the survey of businesses that informs those statistics was \u201cwell below average.\u201d BLS also said there was no discernible effect on the national unemployment rate.Economists had warned the Boeing Co. strike as well as the two powerful hurricanes \u2014 Helene and Milton \u2014 that hit the Southeast in late September and early October would more negatively impact the payrolls number than the survey that informs the unemployment rate. Payrolls estimates varied widely as a result, from a decline of 10,000 to a gain of 180,000.The jobs report is the last major data point on the US economy before next week\u2019s Federal Reserve meeting and the November 5 presidential election, a race where the issue has consistently ranked top of mind for voters. Other figures this week showed the economy grew at a strong pace in the third quarter, fueled by solid consumer spending, while inflation picked up in September.With a number of caveats to glean through, economists and policymakers will likely take little signal from the report, instead looking to other data that show the labor market is cooling gradually.Stock futures remained higher and Treasury yields dropped following the report.",

        "text": "Samvat 2081: With the onset of the auspicious Vikram Samvat 2081, investors are looking to tap into high growth opportunities for wealth creation and asset management. For the new Hindu financial year, D-Street experts widely suggest investors to build a diversified portfolio to seize maximum returns on various trading instruments.\n\nAnalysts say that as markets embrace Samvat 2081, investors have a remarkable chance to reshape their financial journeys amid a dynamic and evolving market. This period, steeped in tradition and the promise of prosperity, is an ideal time to reassess investment strategies that align with India\u2019s high-growth potential in transformative sectors such as green energy, technology, and financial services.\n\nIn today\u2019s market, diversification is essential. \u201cMutual funds, particularly thematic funds in infrastructure, technology, and renewable energy, offer a balanced, straightforward way for investors at any stage to benefit from long-term growth trends. Index funds like Nifty 50 and Sensex also provide an accessible and low-cost route to capitalize on India\u2019s top-performing companies, especially suited for passive investors aiming for consistent returns, \u201d said Vivek Goel, Joint MD, Tailwind Financial Services.\n\nFor the high-net-worth investors, customized strategies through Portfolio Management Services (PMS) and Alternative Investment Funds (AIF) unlock advanced opportunities, particularly in private equity and venture capital, where emerging trends can be harnessed effectively.\n\nInvesting in blue-chip stocks remains a popular, reliable choice, balancing stability and growth. Leading sectors such as banking, FMCG, and consumer goods consistently show resilience, while growth stocks in renewable energy, fintech, and healthcare offer exciting potential for those exploring mid-cap and small-cap options.\n\nWith steady interest rates, fixed-income securities and debt mutual funds offer stability and regular income, while investments in gold and silver remain cherished for their cultural significance and role as hedges against inflation and volatility. Sovereign Gold Bonds and Gold ETFs also provide tax-efficient, accessible ways to hold precious metals.\n\nReal estate endures as a valued investment, particularly through Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs), allowing investors to benefit from India\u2019s growing commercial real estate sector without the complexities of ownership.\n\nFinally, India\u2019s green energy transformation holds great potential. Companies in solar, wind, and EV infrastructure are well-positioned to thrive, as are ESG-focused funds and new-age investments in startups and digital assets for investors with a higher risk tolerance.\n\n\u201cThis Samvat, let\u2019s align our financial goals with India\u2019s growth trajectory, seeking out opportunities that not only promise prosperity but also contribute to a more sustainable future,\u201d added Goel.\n\nFor enhancing one's portfolio, experts say that mutual funds are the best option to help you meet your financial goals.\n\n\u201cWith Diwali around the corner, it\u2019s an ideal time to reflect on your financial goals and consider investing in Systematic Investment Plans (SIPs). Particularly in small-cap and mid-cap mutual funds, SIPs can help you build significant wealth over the long term if you\u2019re prepared to embrace some level of risk, \u201d said Swapnil Aggarwal, Director, VSRK Capital.\n\nStarting early in one's career gives you the advantage of time. By consistently allocating 20-25 per cent of your monthly income into SIPs, one can tap into the growth potential of small and mid-cap funds, which historically offer a CAGR of 15-18 per cent. Over a span of 10, 15, or even 20 years, this disciplined approach can lead to substantial wealth accumulation. Although small-cap investments are higher in risk, they present immense potential for long-term wealth creation.\n\nThe small-cap and mid-cap sectors, while inherently riskier, are well-suited for long-term investors looking to generate significant returns. These funds are expected to outperform others in the coming decade, making them an attractive option for those with a higher risk tolerance. They can serve as powerful vehicles for achieving long-term financial goals, such as retirement or other major life milestones.\n\n\u201cHowever, while focusing on high-growth small-cap funds, it\u2019s wise to maintain a diversified portfolio that includes large-cap and mid-cap funds. This strategy can help balance your risk profile, ensuring stability and minimizing potential losses during market downturns. When selecting mutual funds, prioritize those with a proven track record of consistent performance over 5-10 years and look for options with low expense ratios to maximize your returns,\u201d said Aggarwal.",

It gives me immense satisfaction that the operating metrics have improved, with loss ratio as well as combined ratio being lower than the same period last year with profit after tax showing a 5x increase. The loss ratio of Health line of business has witnessed some improvement but the loss ratio in Motor line of business has increased due to lack of price increase in the Motor Third Party line of business. Net catastrophic losses in H1 FY25 were around Rs 248 crore. Solvency ratio at 1.81 times remains comfortably above the IRDAI mandated control level solvency margin. The competitive intensity in traditional lines remains high and the company will focus on other segments and channels to drive growth.

        "text": "Domestic equity markets ushered in Samvat 2081 with gains of close to half a per cent, with all sectors making positive contributions. Following the one-hour ceremonial trading session, the Sensex ended at 79,724, up 335 points, or 0.42 per cent, while the Nifty 50 index finished at 24,304, gaining 99 points, or 0.41 per cent.\u00a0The broader Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 outperformed, rising 0.7 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. Overall, 3,038 stocks finished with gains, while only 539 ended with losses on the BSE.\u00a0Bourses conducted a special one-hour ceremonial Muhurat trading session to mark the new Hindu calendar year (Samvat 2081). This marked the seventh consecutive year that the equity markets have ended with gains on Muhurat trading day.\u00a0While domestic markets were shut for normal trading, global cues remained mixed as investors awaited the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate verdict and the outcome of the US elections due next week. US equities rose about 1 per cent after disappointing jobs data bolstered rate cut hopes.\u00a0Markets are entering Samvat 2081 on a turbulent note. The Sensex and the Nifty have dropped over 7 per cent each from their highs on September 26. The Nifty Midcap 100 is down close to 7.2 per cent, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 has declined over 3.9 per cent from their respective peaks.\u00a0While the markets added Rs 125 trillion in market value in Samvat 2080, India\u2019s market capitalisation is down by Rs 30 trillion from its highs.\u00a0Some analysts believe the ongoing market correction provides a good entry point for investors who have been waiting on the sidelines for over a year. However, navigating the market may not be straightforward as equities face headwinds from tepid earnings growth for the current financial year, lingering geopolitical tensions, and relentless selling by overseas funds amid the appeal of more attractively priced Chinese markets.\u00a0In October, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out a record Rs 87,639 crore from domestic stocks, triggering a 6.22 per cent decline in the Nifty\u2014its biggest monthly fall since March 2020.\u00a0\u201cThe Nifty returned 25 per cent in Samvat 2080, so investors should be satisfied. However, the correction in October\u2014the first monthly fall of over 5 per cent in 54 months\u2014has raised concerns about future market performance. Of serious concern is the relentless FPI selling. Given India\u2019s elevated valuations and concerns over slowing earnings growth, the selling might continue, impacting benchmark indices. In such a scenario, investors should focus on stock-specific investments in companies with strong earnings visibility,\u201d said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\u00a0With more companies missing estimates than meeting them, analysts have scaled back earnings growth expectations for FY25 from 10 per cent to below 3 per cent. This limits how much the markets can rally from here. Despite the recent decline, the Nifty trades at 21.8 times its 12-month forward earnings, slightly above the long-term average of 20.7 times. Broader markets, such as the Nifty Midcap 100, are trading at high valuations of 31 times, against their 10-year average of 17 times.\u00a0\u201cWhile the long-term growth story for Indian equities remains robust, current valuations leave limited room for expansion. This means that corporate earnings growth will be a critical driver of market returns. Stock picking with a balance of growth at a reasonable price and quality will be essential to achieving good returns over the coming year,\u201d said Pranav Haridasan, managing director and chief executive officer, Axis Securities.",

Traders added to bets that policymakers will cut rates by a quarter-point on November 7, just two days after the US election. A key gauge of the dollar slumped to its lowest in more than a week.The job report showed just 12,000 jobs created in October, with the data distorted by severe hurricanes and a major strike and coming in well below the median economist forecast of 100,000.

        "text": "The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) CEO, Sundararaman Ramamurthy is eagerly anticipating the potential listing of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), seeing it as a unique opportunity.As a former NSE executive, Ramamurthy expressed both pride and optimism about the listing , noting that it would be meaningful on multiple fronts. \"It will give some revenue to me, it will be a matter of great pride as an ex-NSEite, and the largest stock exchange of this country getting listed with me,\" he remarked. The potential listing, he believes, will be a source of significant value for the BSE.He has also projected an optimistic outlook for Samvat 2081 expecting a prosperous year ahead for investors.Ramamurthy cited robust market fundamentals, including significant mutual fund contributions and favourable economic indicators, as key factors driving this positive forecast. \"Any parameter \u2013 whether it is capital raising, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, or even the monsoon \u2013 everything appears positive. Therefore, it is a clear estimate that 2081 will be a bountiful year for investors,\" he said.Ramamurthy also highlighted the continued enthusiasm from new investors, driven by the favourable demographic profile of the country, steady GDP growth, and controlled inflation. \"The youth are increasingly participating in financial markets and mutual funds, driven by the ongoing financialisation of their savings. This demographic shift is supporting a strong, disciplined inflow of investments into mutual funds, with systematic investment plans (SIPs) remaining popular,\" he said.Addressing the rising activity in the Futures and Options (F&O) market, Ramamurthy acknowledged the importance of responsible participation, especially for new investors. He emphasised the strong regulatory framework established by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which has prioritised investor protection and contributed to the steady development of India\u2019s financial markets. \"The regulatory efforts have made it possible for the growth and protection of investors, which is a significant achievement,\" he added.Ramamurthy offered advice to investors, emphasising the importance of informed decisions in trading. \"You need to understand what you trade and trade what you understand. If one of those conditions is not fulfilled, avoid participating. Assess your risk appetite carefully and trade accordingly,\" he said.For beginner investors, Ramamurthy recommended mutual funds, particularly large-cap funds, as a safer option. Collective investment schemes, like mutual funds, are managed by professionals who handle diversification and portfolio adjustments for investors. It\u2019s a suitable route if one is unfamiliar with market risk and looking to invest safely, he concluded.",

        "text": "Investing in global equity markets can be an attractive option for Indian investors, but what are the rules for accessing these markets? What should investors keep in mind, and what risks should they consider before making the decision?In a discussion, Chintan Haria from ICICI Prudential AMC and Mohit Gang, CEO and Co-Founder of Moneyfront.in, explored the advantages, drawbacks, and options for Indian investors interested in global equities.Haria said that international investing has its appeal, especially as more investors focus on diversifying their portfolios. According to him, ICICI has long advocated for asset allocation, suggesting that a 10% to 15% investment in international markets could be beneficial. However, he added that international markets operate differently due to the involvement of various countries, each with unique economic cycles.For instance, said Haria, Japan\u2019s recent performance is an example of how different regions present unique opportunities. Haria emphasized that while global access has become easier, investors should still seek professional guidance and fully understand the process, as specific restrictions may still apply.Gang agreed with Haria\u2019s points and further stated the importance of diversification. He pointed out that while India has performed well recently, the US S&P 500 has consistently outpaced the Indian Nifty index over 1-year, 3-year, 5-year, and 15-year time frames. He explained that this comparison underlines the potential benefits of investing in global markets.He added that India comprises only a small segment of the global market cap, making international diversification essential for reducing risks related to domestic volatility. According to Gang, investors should aim for a diversified portfolio, allocating around 10% to 20% to international markets through direct investments or mutual funds.For the entire discussion, watch the accompanying video",

        "text": "As Samvat 2080 comes to an end, gold and silver have surged to unprecedented levels, benefiting from central bank demand, global economic shifts, and a strong appetite for safe-haven assets. The rally in these metals has been further supported by investors seeking portfolio diversification amid economic uncertainty.Max Layton of Citi, Kunal Shah of Nirmal Bang Securities, and Chirag Sheth of MetalFocus each foresee continued strength in these commodities, projecting high price targets driven by supply deficits and heightened demand across sectors.Max Layton, Global Head of Commodities at Citi, pointed out that gold has exhibited \"very steady, positive momentum\" amid rising rates and strong economic data, which have typically weighed on gold. Citi has maintained its target for gold at $3,000 per ounce since the beginning of the year, and Layton believes it could be reached in the next six months.Layton attributes gold\u2019s 35% rally this year to strong investment demand, notably from central banks and ETF buyers across Asia, North America, and Europe, with North American ETF demand leading in the third quarter.Discussing silver, Layton pointed to a sustained deficit in the market, driven by industrial and investment demand that has kept inventory levels historically tight. \"For the past five years, we have seen an annual deficit of 15-20% of silver's global consumption,\" he explained, emphasising that this imbalance has spurred turnover in bar and coin inventories.Layton predicts further price gains, expecting silver to hit $40 per ounce within 6-12 months. The fundamental tightness in the silver market, coupled with a projected slowdown in the US labour market, is set to further fuel demand for the metal as a safe-haven asset, he added.Chirag Sheth from MetalFocus echoed this optimism, particularly for silver, emphasising its growing demand for renewable energy and electric vehicles. \"We expect silver prices to rise beyond $40, fueled by strong demand from sectors like solar panels and electric vehicles,\" said Sheth.With the silver market in a widening deficit, he foresees sustained bullish momentum for the metal over the next 12 to 18 months. On gold, Sheth aligned with the $3,000 target, adding that a consolidation phase may follow but that the long-term outlook remains robust.Kunal Shah of Nirmal Bang Securities took a similar bullish stance, setting a target for gold at $3,200 per ounce. \"The gold rally has plenty of legs,\" Shah asserted, emphasising that the metal\u2019s resilience over the past two decades makes it a compelling choice for investors.For Shah, the persistent upward trend is driven by an alignment of geopolitical and economic factors, including potential Federal Reserve rate cuts or geopolitical escalations. He cautions that while minor corrections are likely, the underlying strength of gold as an investment remains intact, projecting conservative annualised returns of 10-15% over the next two years.",

The auto index gained 1.24% and was the top sectoral gainer by percentage.Mahindra & Mahindra climbed 3.27% after reporting a 25% jump in October car sales to dealers, helped by festive demand. It was the top Nifty 50 gainer as well.The broader, more domestically focussed mid and small-caps rose about 0.7% and 1%, respectively.\"Despite the recent fall in the markets, the optimism during the muhurat trading signifies positive investor sentiment,\" said Vikas Gupta, chief executive at OmniScience Capital.While the recent correction has made segments in domestic markets attractive in terms of valuations, the near-term trajectory will depend on the U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday and U.S. presidential elections next week besides domestic corporate earnings and foreign outflows, two analysts said.Among individual stocks, construction company NCC gained 4.60% after securing orders worth 34.96 billion rupees in the previous month.Hospital-chain operator Narayana Hrudayalaya fell 2% on posting a lower quarterly profit.",

Suri clarified that he is not setting any specific targets but expressed optimism, saying, \"As an investor, I do see the next 12 months continuing to be rewarding.\"Suri said he remains very optimistic about the market, adding, \"I still believe that before next Diwali, or even well before it, we will hit a new high.\"He noted that it's important to watch the 23,200 zone on the downside carefully, as he expects it to be a strong support level. He mentioned that the market is currently presenting good buying opportunities, and he anticipates a strong second half of the year.\"The immediate area of concern would be around 23,200 The reason is that, obviously there is a pattern formation. But more importantly is that just if you look before the election results, the top was around 23,000-23,200 then we fell at 8-9%. So, I feel that pre-election level will work out as a very big base. This is around 23,200, which is what about 3-4% lower than here. So, I feel that that's going to actually be a very big, solid base, that would be the area of immediate concern,\" he said.In the near term, the market will be more stock-specific, but Suri expects that industrials will lead the movement again in the second half.\"I believe that the longer-term and medium-term bullishness persists. I expect that within the next 12 months, we will challenge and break out to new highs,\" he told CNBC-TV18 during the Diwali Mahurat trading session.Further, Suri added added: \"As I mentioned, there has been a pause, and we must acknowledge the significant amount of FII selling that has occurred, along with the substantial withdrawals of money from the market, thanks to the IPO funding that has come in. Additionally, it's important to recognize that the numbers are mixed. Therefore, the market needs to take a pause. This is crucial because, for a bull run to sustain, intermediate corrections, pauses, and some form of reality check are necessary.\"Meanwhile, the Indian stock market begin Samvat 2081 positively, with frontline indices rising by up to 1%.

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Bitcoin\u2019s push toward a record high is fizzling as pro-crypto Republican nominee Donald Trump\u2019s election odds drop in betting markets.\n\nThe biggest digital asset traded around $70,000 after sliding 4% \u2014 the most in a month \u2014 a day earlier. The retreat comes alongside a narrowing of Trump\u2019s lead over Democratic candidate Vice President Kamala Harris on PredictIt, Polymarket and Kalshi, where people can bet on election results.\n\nBitcoin has been dubbed a Trump trade because of the former president\u2019s tight embrace of the crypto industry, which spent big on promoting its agenda during campaigning.

        "text": "Just days ahead of the Nov. 5 presidential election in the U.S., investors are trying to gauge how stock markets will react as polls and betting platforms point to a tight race between Vice President Kamala Harris and former President Donald Trump.\n\nHarris' lead over the Republican has dwindled to a single percentage point in the final stretch of the presidential contest, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll published on Tuesday.\n\nA majority of a dozen analysts that Reuters spoke to expect a Trump return to boost equity markets, with some favoring a split government.\n\nCrypto stocks and small-caps have gained in the lead up to the election.\n\nTrump's pledge to cut corporate taxes and decrease regulations could boost markets in the short-term if he wins, said Bel Air Investment Advisors Chairman Todd Morgan.\n\nOn the other hand, Trump has promised to double down on trade tariffs, especially against China, and \"rescind all unspent funds\" under a signature Biden-Harris climate law that includes hundreds of billions of dollars in subsidies for electric vehicles, solar and other clean energy technologies.\n\nA divided Congress may be the best outcome as it limits what the president can accomplish and spend, according to Brian Klimke, chief market strategist at Cetera Investment Management.\n\nHere's a list of stocks and sectors that could move on the election outcome:\n\nTRUMP TRADE\n\nBANKS: A Trump win or Republican sweep could lift Wall Street banks such as JPMorgan Chase, Bank of America and Wells Fargo on improved domestic investment, looser regulations, domestic job additions and tax cuts, Bank of America analysts said.\n\nHowever, concerns around a wider trade deficit and tariffs are viewed as negative for the sector.\n\nM&A beneficiaries include Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, Lazard and Evercore amid a more lenient approach to antitrust regulation enforcement.\n\nCRYPTO: A more \"receptive\" regulatory approach to digital assets under a Trump win could benefit crypto stocks, according to TD Cowen analysts who highlighted the likelihood of the former president naming a pro-crypto SEC chair.\n\nMicroStrategy, Riot Platforms, MARA Holdings, Hut 8 and Bit Digital climbed between 3.4% and 45% in October.\n\nENERGY: Morgan Stanley analysts believe a Trump presidency could prioritize reducing the regulatory burden on domestic oil and gas production, while considering the possibility of more restrictive trade policies.\n\n\"Trump's support for fossil fuel industries could benefit oil and gas stocks, as he would likely pursue policies that favor domestic energy production,\" said Daniela Hathorn, senior market analyst at Capital.com.\n\nTrump could leverage authority to rapidly increase production levels, which would benefit exploration companies such as Chevron, Exxon Mobil, and ConocoPhillips .\n\nHe could also reverse the Biden administration's pause on permitting new LNG export projects, likely benefiting Baker Hughes and Chart Industries. However, Trump's proposed 60% tariff on imports from China could hit LNG exporters like Cheniere Energy and New Fortress Energy in case of any retaliatory actions.\n\nTRUMP-RELATED STOCKS: Trump Media & Technology Group , in which Trump owns a majority stake, software firm Phunware and video-sharing platform Rumble stand to gain further if he wins. Both Phunware and Trump Media & Technology have doubled in October after sluggish performance in recent months.\n\nPRISON OPERATORS: Geo Group and CoreCivic may benefit from Trump's re-election, on promises of a crackdown on illegal immigration and restrictions on legal immigration, which could boost demand for detention centers.\n\nCARRIERS: Wells Fargo analysts said the proposed tariff on Chinese imports under a Trump term could hurt demand for parcel carriers FedEx and United Parcel Service, and forwarder C.H. Robinson Worldwide, which have substantial exposure to China.\n\nSMALL-CAP STOCKS: U.S.-focused companies could benefit from business incentives and tariffs that favor domestic production. The small-cap Russell 2000 index has risen nearly 9% so far in 2024.\n\nHARRIS BASKET\n\nHOMEBUILDERS: Harris' pledge to build more homes and reduce costs for renters and home buyers largely through tax incentives, coupled with a benign interest-rate environment, could boost homebuilders D.R. Horton, KB Home, Lennar, PulteGroup, Zillow Group and Toll Brothers.\n\nHEALTHCARE: The sector has been a key focus for the Harris campaign.\n\nShe has pledged to cut healthcare costs by implementing caps on prescription drug prices, such as limiting insulin prices to $35. This could weigh on profit margins for pharmaceutical giants such as Eli Lilly, Merck, and Pfizer .\n\nAndrew Wells, CIO of SanJac Alpha, however, expects healthcare insurers such as Humana and UnitedHealth Group to likely benefit from expanded coverage under a Harris presidency.\n\nCORPORATE TAXES: Harris' proposal to tax corporations and the wealthy includes a 28% corporate tax rate and that could help the U.S. deficit.\n\nAccording to Stock Analysis, Microsoft, Apple , and Alphabet were the three firms shouldering the highest income taxes over the past 12 months, collectively amounting to $67.73 billion.\n\n\"It is highly unlikely to see a blue wave, but if that happens, the market reaction could be temporarily negative due to the prospects of higher corporate tax rates,\" said Cetera's Klimke.\n\nRENEWABLE STOCKS: Green energy is poised to thrive under Harris, with the potential for increased incentives and supportive policies as well as regulations on big oil firms, according to Capital.com's Hathorn.\n\nHarris will aim to significantly reduce pollution by 2035, aligning with the Paris Agreement \u2014 a climate pact Trump has vowed to withdraw.",

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- Intel Corp. shares surged after the chipmaker gave a revenue forecast slightly above estimates, sparking optimism that it\u2019s capable of reclaiming some lost market share.\n\nFourth-quarter revenue will be $13.3 billion to $14.3 billion, the Santa Clara, California-based company said in a statement on Thursday. That compares with the $13.6 billion analysts estimated on average. The firm is projecting a profit of 12 cents per share compared with the 6 cents Wall Street was expecting.\n\nAlso Read | Intel rises on recovery hopes as it forecasts revenue above estimates\n\nThe company gained as much as 7.3% after markets opened in New York on Friday. The shares were down 57% through Thursday\u2019s close.\n\nIntel, once the industry leader in computer processors, is now working to preserve cash to fund a turnaround plan \u2014 one Chief Executive Officer Pat Gelsinger called the \u201cmost audacious rebuilding plan\u201d in corporate history, in an interview with Bloomberg.\n\nIn the prior quarter, Intel cut jobs, slashed its spending and suspended investor payouts. The total headcount reduction will be 16,500. Now, Gelsinger needs to show that he can counterbalance the cash drain by generating new orders from customers.\n\nAlso Read | Inside Intel, CEO Pat Gelsinger fumbled the revival of an American icon\n\n\u201cThis was a critical period of time for the company,\u201d Gelsinger said in the interview. \u201cWe got a lot done.\u201d\n\nThe fall from investor favor for what was once the world\u2019s largest chipmaker underlines a major shift in semiconductor industry in favor of artificial intelligence hardware. Companies are spending on computers built around accelerator chips for AI, an area where Intel\u2019s offerings have barely made a dent. Instead, customers are fleeing for Nvidia Corp, fueling its massive rise.\n\nOrders for Intel\u2019s AI accelerator chip, Gaudi, have been weaker than projected and it won\u2019t now reach the company\u2019s $500 million revenue target this year, Gelsinger said on the post-earnings call with investors. Rival Advanced Micro Devices Inc. earlier this week increased its forecast for a similar product to more than $5 billion. Nvidia is on course to have revenue of more than $100 billion from its AI chip unit this year, according to analysts.\n\nIntel\u2019s decline in value has made it attractive to potential acquirers in various break-up scenarios, according to reporting by Bloomberg and other news organizations. Gelsinger has said some of the business units he thinks are undervalued will seek outside investors or look to sell shares to the public.\n\nGelsinger said he intends to keep the company together and has the support of the board for his plan. He has a \u201clot of energy and passion\u201d to bring to that effort, he said.\n\n\u201cObviously, there\u2019s a lot of attention on Intel which just reinforces what a central role it plays in the technology industry,\u201d he said in the interview. \u201cWe believe distinct, but better together, is the strategy.\u201d\n\nThe company is in negotiations with potential investors for its Altera programmable chip unit. It expects to conclude that process early next year, Gelsinger said on a call with investors. Meanwhile, he\u2019s reviewing options for similar actions for other parts of Intel\u2019s business.\n\nIntel\u2019s leader was one of the chief lobbyists for the Chips and Science Act, a Biden administration industrial policy aimed at bringing back chip manufacturing to the US with tens of billions of dollars in public money support.\n\nGelsinger, in an interview with Bloomberg Television, said that Intel hasn\u2019t yet received any of the funds to help with construction of new facilities in Arizona and Ohio, and criticized the speed at which support has been made available.\n\nStill, he remains confident that, regardless of who wins the US presidential election, the initiative will continue. \u201cThe Chips Act was a bipartisan act with strong support from both sides of the aisle,\u201d he said.\n\nThe company is also under siege in its traditional stronghold of selling processors for servers and personal computers. For decades, its superior manufacturing made its chips the market leader and locked down an improbably high market share. Since losing its lead in process technology to rival Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., others such as Nvidia and AMD have been able to field competitive chips made by the provider of outsourced production.\n\nGelsinger\u2019s expensive plans to take back leadership in that crucial area involve a new factory network that he plans to fill with orders from other chipmakers, in addition to Intel\u2019s own designs. In the interim, Intel is facing depressed revenue and elevated costs. That\u2019s destroyed profit margins that were once the envy of the industry.\n\nGross margin, or the percentage of sales remaining after deducting the cost of production, was 15% in the quarter. At its peak, Intel regularly reported gross margin of well above 60%.\n\nIn the third quarter, the company had a loss of 46 cents a share, excluding certain items, and revenue of $13.3 billion, down 6%. That quarterly sales total is its lowest for the third quarter in more than a decade but came in ahead of company projections, Gelsinger said.\n\nAnalysts had estimated a loss of 3 cents a share and sales of $13 billion. Wall Street is projecting a modest increase in overall sales this year from 2024, still leaving the company more than $20 billion below its peak in 2021.\n\nGelsinger remains confident that Intel is on the right track in the long run. He said Intel has paid the heavy price of catching up to the industry, and now can focus on its finances.\n\nThe chipmaker is reporting earnings for the third time under a new business structure that shows the financial performance of its manufacturing operations. Gelsinger has said the restructuring was a necessary step to make operations more efficient and competitive.\n\nIts so-called foundry unit had sales that slipped 8% from the prior-year quarter to $4.4 billion, in line with estimates. PC chip sales were $7.3 billion, versus an estimate of $7.46 billion. It\u2019s data center and AI chip unit gained 9% for sales of $3.3 billion, compared with an average estimate of $3.1 billion.\n\nFor the next two years, the majority of work done by Intel\u2019s factories will come from orders from its own chip design unit. The financial benefit of outside business will start to show up in 2026, Gelsinger said.\n\nGelsinger emphasized on the call with investors that Intel is \u201cfar from satisfied\u201d with where it is.\n\n--With assistance from Ed Ludlow.\n\n(Updates with opening share move in the third paragraph.)\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

        "text": "After a sterling year that took stocks to record highs, Samvat 2081 kicked off on a positive note, with stock benchmarks ending in the green. However, market veterans had words of caution for the road ahead: Do not expect a replay of Samvat 2080, preserve capital, and limit your expectations.\n\nThe Nifty 50 and Sensex closed on a positive note during Friday's special Diwali Muhurat trading session, rising 0.4% each at 24,304.35 and 79,724.12 points respectively. The two indices have gained 24% and 22% respectively in Samvat 2080, the highest since Samvat 2077. During the year, the Nifty 50 hit record highs in 78 out of 242 trading sessions, according to data from Capitaline.\n\nAlso read | India's IPO Rush: 336 companies go public in Samvat 2080, dominated by SMEs Experts said Samvat 2081 will be a stock picker's market, highlighting the importance of careful selection in an environment where return expectations are likely to be more subdued as compared to previous years.\n\nAlpha generation will be increasingly driven by stock selection rather than sector selection\n\nRahul Singh, chief investment officer of Tata Asset Management, said that going ahead, \u201cAlpha generation will be increasingly driven by stock selection rather than sector selection\u201d. He explained that strong macroeconomic indicators are currently being offset by cuts in earnings forecasts. This, he said, could lead to a consolidation phase where thematic trends fade and a more bottom-up approach takes over.\n\nRight stock over right sector Gaurav Dua, senior vice-president & head, capital market strategy, Sharekhan by BNP Paribas, agreed that selecting the right stock, rather than the right sector, will be key. \u201cEven as the multi-year outlook for the Indian economy and markets continue to be positive, Samvat 2081 could see moderation in returns driven by global uncertainties and slowing growth in earnings domestically,\u201d he cautioned.\n\nVetri Subramaniam, chief investment officer of UTI Asset Management Co., said, \u201cThe key point is that you've essentially borrowed some future returns\u2014that\u2019s the reality. Be aware of this if you're considering selling your position\u201d.\n\nMoreover, expecting to achieve returns that exceed earnings growth from this starting point is a risky assumption, he added. \u201cYour best guess for returns will likely align with earnings growth. However, given that the valuations are currently high, there\u2019s a possibility that returns could dip below earnings growth if valuations start to normalize,\u201d he explained.\n\nAlso read | Diwali Bonanza: 3 stocks to light up your portfolio in Samvat 2081 Taking a valuation-based approach, Vetri feels much more comfortable with large-cap stocks. In contrast, his comfort with mid and smallcaps is limited, largely because their valuations already account for anticipated future growth.\n\nNilesh Shah, managing director at Kotak Mahindra AMC, stressed that within equities, investors should prioritize quality over momentum, favour large-cap stocks over midcaps and smallcaps, and concentrate on reasonable valuations rather than expensive ones as they move forward.\n\nMid-, small-cap show When comparing the returns of Indian equities to other asset classes, gold delivered a 32% return, while silver saw a 39% increase in Samvat 2080. The rupee declined by 1%, and 10-year bonds by 5%. However, BSE midcaps and smallcaps stood out as the top performers, soaring over 40%, according to Capitaline data.\n\nShah believes that replicating the returns of the past five years will be challenging over the next five years. \u201cTherefore, it\u2019s essential to moderate our return expectations,\u201d he said.\n\nVipul Bhowar, senior director, listed investments, Waterfield Advisors is of the view that inflationary pressures, geopolitical uncertainty, and the potential for a global economic slowdown may lead to further market corrections. \u201cIn this context, investors should focus on capital preservation and anticipate modest returns for Samvat 2081.\u201d\n\nHe believes sectors related to domestic growth themes\u2014such as financials (particularly insurance), consumption (including real estate ancillary sectors), power (notably renewable energy), and healthcare to perform well.\n\nAlso read | 75 stocks double investors wealth in Samvat 2080; IREDA tops the list Among all sectors, the top performers in the last Samvat were Nifty PSE, Nifty Realty, Nifty Healthcare index, Nifty Pharma, and Nifty Auto, fetching 44-60% returns. On the contrary, Nifty Media, Nifty Private Bank, Nifty FMCG, Nifty Bank and Nifty Financial Services have been the biggest laggards.\n\nSiddhartha Khemka, head of research, wealth management, Motilal Oswal Financial Services, pointed out that \u201cMarkets are moving towards defensive sectors to offset the volatility rising due to various headwinds\u201d.\n\nDiscretionary consumption is expected to benefit from swift changes in consumer purchasing behaviour, shifting from unorganized/local channels to organized ones. The ongoing festive season, along with a better-than-anticipated monsoon from July to September 2024, has led to a surge in rural consumption, serving as a near-term catalyst for enhanced economic activity.\n\n[N]iche sectors like jewellery, electronic manufacturing, electric vehicles, renewables, e-commerce, and digital themes are expected to experience significant growth.\n\nIn healthcare, domestic business remains strong, driven by niche product launches. Additionally, financial sector valuations remain favourable, and with growth visibility improving in the coming quarters, Khemka anticipates that this sector will outperform. \u201cApart from these sectors, niche sectors like jewellery, electronic manufacturing, electric vehicles, renewables, e-commerce, and digital themes are expected to experience significant growth,\u201d Khemka said.\n\nAmid rate-cut cycle Samvat 2081 begins as a global rate-cut cycle gets under way. With more cuts likely ahead, investor sentiment is expected to remain buoyant.\n\n\u201cRBI has switched to a \u201cneutral\u201d stance in response, hinting at potential rate cuts in the next 6 to 9 months. We anticipate one to two rate cuts from the RBI in Samvat 2081, contingent on inflation and growth dynamics,\u201d said a Yes Securities (India) report dated 28 October.\n\n\u201cAlthough FII outflows have touched peak levels as of now, FII (foreign institutional investors) holdings as a percentage of market capitalization are way below the levels of the 2003-2007 cycle flourish,\u201d the report highlighted. \u201cWe reckon declining risk-free rates and stable Indian Rupee will attract significant FII inflows, especially given the limited opportunities in sluggish markets like China. Clearly, India is in a long-term structural bull market, marked by manageable corrections along the way.\u201d\n\nAlso read | Samvat 2081: Here's how you can seize high-growth opportunities with SIPs, MFs According to NSDL data, FIIs purchased Indian equities worth \u20b982,414 crore, while domestic institutional investors (DIIs) acquired \u20b94,62,069 crore in shares from the start of Samvat 2080 through 31 October, 2024.\n\nAll things considered, the US elections will be a crucial event for investors to watch in the new Samvat. Experts assert that market returns are primarily driven by the overall economic landscape and the policies of the governing party. Thus, understanding the positions of each candidate or party is important for evaluating their potential effects on different sectors.\n\nThe US 2024 election campaign has entered its final week, with elections scheduled for 5 November. Opinion polls are exceedingly close, making it challenging to forecast the outcome.",

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- A weak October employment report keeps Federal Reserve officials on track to cut interest rates by a quarter point when they meet next week and gives them room to continue lowering borrowing costs.\n\nNonfarm payrolls increased just 12,000 last month, but the figures were likely distorted by two hurricanes and a major strike at Boeing Co., the Bureau of Labor Statistics said. Hiring in August and September, however, were weaker than previously estimated, according to data released Friday, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%.\n\nThe muddied report provides more evidence that the labor market is still down-shifting from the overheated levels seen a few years ago, supporting the case for Fed officials to keep dialing back the restrictive rates they put into place to quash inflation.",

        "text": "Domestic equity markets ushered in Samvat 2081 with gains of close to half a per cent, with all sectors making positive contributions. Following the one-hour ceremonial trading session, the Sensex ended at 79,724, up 335 points, or 0.42 per cent, while the Nifty 50 index finished at 24,304, gaining 99 points, or 0.41 per cent.\u00a0The broader Nifty Midcap 100 and Smallcap 100 outperformed, rising 0.7 per cent and 1 per cent, respectively. Overall, 3,038 stocks finished with gains, while only 539 ended with losses on the BSE.\u00a0Bourses conducted a special one-hour ceremonial Muhurat trading session to mark the new Hindu calendar year (Samvat 2081). This marked the seventh consecutive year that the equity markets have ended with gains on Muhurat trading day.\u00a0While domestic markets were shut for normal trading, global cues remained mixed as investors awaited the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate verdict and the outcome of the US elections due next week. US equities rose about 1 per cent after disappointing jobs data bolstered rate cut hopes.\u00a0Markets are entering Samvat 2081 on a turbulent note. The Sensex and the Nifty have dropped over 7 per cent each from their highs on September 26. The Nifty Midcap 100 is down close to 7.2 per cent, and the Nifty Smallcap 100 has declined over 3.9 per cent from their respective peaks.\u00a0While the markets added Rs 125 trillion in market value in Samvat 2080, India\u2019s market capitalisation is down by Rs 30 trillion from its highs.\u00a0Some analysts believe the ongoing market correction provides a good entry point for investors who have been waiting on the sidelines for over a year. However, navigating the market may not be straightforward as equities face headwinds from tepid earnings growth for the current financial year, lingering geopolitical tensions, and relentless selling by overseas funds amid the appeal of more attractively priced Chinese markets.\u00a0In October, foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) pulled out a record Rs 87,639 crore from domestic stocks, triggering a 6.22 per cent decline in the Nifty\u2014its biggest monthly fall since March 2020.\u00a0\u201cThe Nifty returned 25 per cent in Samvat 2080, so investors should be satisfied. However, the correction in October\u2014the first monthly fall of over 5 per cent in 54 months\u2014has raised concerns about future market performance. Of serious concern is the relentless FPI selling. Given India\u2019s elevated valuations and concerns over slowing earnings growth, the selling might continue, impacting benchmark indices. In such a scenario, investors should focus on stock-specific investments in companies with strong earnings visibility,\u201d said V K Vijayakumar, chief investment strategist, Geojit Financial Services.\u00a0With more companies missing estimates than meeting them, analysts have scaled back earnings growth expectations for FY25 from 10 per cent to below 3 per cent. This limits how much the markets can rally from here. Despite the recent decline, the Nifty trades at 21.8 times its 12-month forward earnings, slightly above the long-term average of 20.7 times. Broader markets, such as the Nifty Midcap 100, are trading at high valuations of 31 times, against their 10-year average of 17 times.\u00a0\u201cWhile the long-term growth story for Indian equities remains robust, current valuations leave limited room for expansion. This means that corporate earnings growth will be a critical driver of market returns. Stock picking with a balance of growth at a reasonable price and quality will be essential to achieving good returns over the coming year,\u201d said Pranav Haridasan, managing director and chief executive officer, Axis Securities.",

        "text": "The Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) CEO, Sundararaman Ramamurthy is eagerly anticipating the potential listing of the National Stock Exchange (NSE), seeing it as a unique opportunity.As a former NSE executive, Ramamurthy expressed both pride and optimism about the listing , noting that it would be meaningful on multiple fronts. \"It will give some revenue to me, it will be a matter of great pride as an ex-NSEite, and the largest stock exchange of this country getting listed with me,\" he remarked. The potential listing, he believes, will be a source of significant value for the BSE.He has also projected an optimistic outlook for Samvat 2081 expecting a prosperous year ahead for investors.Ramamurthy cited robust market fundamentals, including significant mutual fund contributions and favourable economic indicators, as key factors driving this positive forecast. \"Any parameter \u2013 whether it is capital raising, gross domestic product (GDP) growth, or even the monsoon \u2013 everything appears positive. Therefore, it is a clear estimate that 2081 will be a bountiful year for investors,\" he said.Ramamurthy also highlighted the continued enthusiasm from new investors, driven by the favourable demographic profile of the country, steady GDP growth, and controlled inflation. \"The youth are increasingly participating in financial markets and mutual funds, driven by the ongoing financialisation of their savings. This demographic shift is supporting a strong, disciplined inflow of investments into mutual funds, with systematic investment plans (SIPs) remaining popular,\" he said.Addressing the rising activity in the Futures and Options (F&O) market, Ramamurthy acknowledged the importance of responsible participation, especially for new investors. He emphasised the strong regulatory framework established by the Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI), which has prioritised investor protection and contributed to the steady development of India\u2019s financial markets. \"The regulatory efforts have made it possible for the growth and protection of investors, which is a significant achievement,\" he added.Ramamurthy offered advice to investors, emphasising the importance of informed decisions in trading. \"You need to understand what you trade and trade what you understand. If one of those conditions is not fulfilled, avoid participating. Assess your risk appetite carefully and trade accordingly,\" he said.For beginner investors, Ramamurthy recommended mutual funds, particularly large-cap funds, as a safer option. Collective investment schemes, like mutual funds, are managed by professionals who handle diversification and portfolio adjustments for investors. It\u2019s a suitable route if one is unfamiliar with market risk and looking to invest safely, he concluded.",

The cake size of wealth is increasing. People used to go to real estate and gold, now people have realised that besides them, equity gives good returns,\" Anand Rathi said.\n\nHe maintained his bullish view on banking, NBFCs, FMCG, pharma and infrastructure.",

        "text": "As Samvat 2080 comes to an end, gold and silver have surged to unprecedented levels, benefiting from central bank demand, global economic shifts, and a strong appetite for safe-haven assets. The rally in these metals has been further supported by investors seeking portfolio diversification amid economic uncertainty.Max Layton of Citi, Kunal Shah of Nirmal Bang Securities, and Chirag Sheth of MetalFocus each foresee continued strength in these commodities, projecting high price targets driven by supply deficits and heightened demand across sectors.Max Layton, Global Head of Commodities at Citi, pointed out that gold has exhibited \"very steady, positive momentum\" amid rising rates and strong economic data, which have typically weighed on gold. Citi has maintained its target for gold at $3,000 per ounce since the beginning of the year, and Layton believes it could be reached in the next six months.Layton attributes gold\u2019s 35% rally this year to strong investment demand, notably from central banks and ETF buyers across Asia, North America, and Europe, with North American ETF demand leading in the third quarter.Discussing silver, Layton pointed to a sustained deficit in the market, driven by industrial and investment demand that has kept inventory levels historically tight. \"For the past five years, we have seen an annual deficit of 15-20% of silver's global consumption,\" he explained, emphasising that this imbalance has spurred turnover in bar and coin inventories.Layton predicts further price gains, expecting silver to hit $40 per ounce within 6-12 months. The fundamental tightness in the silver market, coupled with a projected slowdown in the US labour market, is set to further fuel demand for the metal as a safe-haven asset, he added.Chirag Sheth from MetalFocus echoed this optimism, particularly for silver, emphasising its growing demand for renewable energy and electric vehicles. \"We expect silver prices to rise beyond $40, fueled by strong demand from sectors like solar panels and electric vehicles,\" said Sheth.With the silver market in a widening deficit, he foresees sustained bullish momentum for the metal over the next 12 to 18 months. On gold, Sheth aligned with the $3,000 target, adding that a consolidation phase may follow but that the long-term outlook remains robust.Kunal Shah of Nirmal Bang Securities took a similar bullish stance, setting a target for gold at $3,200 per ounce. \"The gold rally has plenty of legs,\" Shah asserted, emphasising that the metal\u2019s resilience over the past two decades makes it a compelling choice for investors.For Shah, the persistent upward trend is driven by an alignment of geopolitical and economic factors, including potential Federal Reserve rate cuts or geopolitical escalations. He cautions that while minor corrections are likely, the underlying strength of gold as an investment remains intact, projecting conservative annualised returns of 10-15% over the next two years.",

        "text": "Apple Inc., heading into its most critical sales period of the year, sparked fresh concerns about revenue growth and lingering weakness in an intensely competitive China market.\n\nFollowing the company\u2019s quarterly earnings report, Apple said that total sales in the December period will rise by a percentage in the low-to-middle single digits. Analysts had been projecting a 7% increase. The company also posted a decline in China revenue last quarter, falling short of estimates.\n\nThe broader picture shows a company still trying to rebound from one of the longest sales slumps in its history. Revenue had declined four straight quarters in fiscal 2023 and only returned solidly in the past two quarters. Apple remains the most valuable company on Earth, but it\u2019s had to contend with a sluggish smartphone market, more competition in China and regulatory scrutiny around the world.\n\nThe concerns weighed on the company\u2019s share prices, sending them down as much as 2.5% in New York on Friday. The stock had been up 17% this year through Thursday\u2019s close, fueled by optimism about Apple\u2019s artificial intelligence prospects.\n\nOverall revenue edged past Wall Street projections last quarter \u2014 helped by global iPhone demand \u2014 but the results show that the company is still struggling in a key market. Apple is competing with local brands in China, which serves as its main manufacturing hub.\n\nRevenue in the region fell slightly from a year earlier to $15 billion in the fourth fiscal quarter, which ended Sept. 28. Analysts had estimated $15.8 billion.\n\nThe iPhone grew in every geographic market, Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook said, signaling that the rest of the company\u2019s product lineup may have been the issue in China, its biggest source of revenue after the Americas and Europe.\n\nTotal sales rose 6.1% to $94.9 billion, compared with an average estimate of $94.4 billion. Earnings were 97 cents a share, though they would have been $1.64 without a one-time charge related to a European General Court decision, Apple said.\n\nThe Cupertino, California-based company introduced the iPhone 16 in September, helping spur upgrades. It also updated Apple Watches and released new AirPods. Those consumer devices account for the majority of the company\u2019s revenue.\n\nInvestors have been betting that Apple Intelligence \u2014 the company\u2019s new suite of AI features \u2014 will help fuel device sales. But the software debuted weeks after the iPhone went on sale, and many of its biggest features are still months away.\n\nApple previously signaled that sales growth would be about 5%, with its services business performing particularly well. Revenue from that division did reach a record high in the period, climbing to $25 billion. But that was just short of the $25.3 billion that Wall Street predicted.\n\nOn a conference call with analysts, Chief Financial Officer Luca Maestri said that services revenue would grow in the double digits in the December quarter, similar to the fiscal 2024 rate. Cook paid tribute to the departing CFO, who is moving to a smaller role. Thursday\u2019s call will be his last, as he\u2019ll be replaced by deputy Kevan Parekh.\n\nRevenue from the iPhone came in at $46.2 billion, beating estimates of $45 billion. That\u2019s up 5.5% from a year earlier. The business may get another boost in 2025, when the company is planning to release a new low-end iPhone SE with Apple Intelligence \u2014 as well as more significant hardware changes to its flagship models.\n\nBut other product divisions fell short of analysts\u2019 estimates last quarter. That included the iPad business and Apple\u2019s wearables division.\n\nThe Mac generated $7.74 billion in revenue, in line with projections. Apple hadn\u2019t released major updates to the Mac lineup until the current quarter, beyond refreshing the MacBook Air with an M3 chip earlier this year.\n\nThis week, Apple added the M4 chip line to the iMac, Mac mini and MacBook Pro \u2014 a trio that should set up the Mac for a successful holiday period. Next year, Apple plans to bring the M4 chip \u2014 a processor designed to speed up AI processing \u2014 to the MacBook Air, Mac Studio and Mac Pro, Bloomberg News has reported.\n\nThe iPad line chalked up sales of $6.95 billion, missing the $7.07 billion projection. After going roughly 18 months without any changes, Apple overhauled the iPad this year, revamping the iPad Pro with the M4 chip and releasing a larger version of the iPad Air. Earlier this month, Apple refreshed the iPad mini with a new chip and support for Apple Intelligence, but sales of that product weren\u2019t included in the fiscal fourth quarter.\n\nApple is planning to give the iPad another boost in the first half of next year when it rolls out a new low-end model aimed at students.\n\nThe company refreshed its Wearables, Home and Accessories lineup in September with the rollout of the Apple Watch Series 10 and a new black version of the Ultra 2 watch. The company also debuted a pair of AirPods 4 models.\n\nBut those relatively modest changes didn\u2019t bring a major sales surge. The segment brought in $9.04, down 3% from a year earlier. Analysts estimated $9.17 billion.\n\nCook visited China earlier this month, promising future cooperation and further investment in the country. Apple has yet to announce plans to roll out Apple Intelligence in the region and is seeking local partners to bring the functionality to its users there.\n\nHomegrown Chinese brands such as Vivo have gained ground in the country. And restrictions on the use of foreign technology at Chinese government offices spread over the past year.\n\nMore broadly, Apple Intelligence remains a question mark for the company. Only a sliver of the platform\u2019s features have been delivered so far, so it\u2019s hard to tell how much they will drive demand in the long run.\n\nIn December, Apple will integrate OpenAI\u2019s ChatGPT into the software and introduce features for editing images with generative AI. An overhaul to the Siri digital assistant won\u2019t arrive until next year.\n\nThough Apple\u2019s services business has been a bright spot, it has its own challenges. The App Store is under fire in various parts of the world, including the EU, where new regulations have forced policy changes. Apple now allows third-party app stores and payment methods in the region, and that could weigh on revenue.\n\nApple also has struggled to find one of its famous \u201cnext big things\u201d \u2014 a major new category that can fuel growth. The Vision Pro headset, which debuted in February, has been a niche product so far. And the company canceled plans to develop a car that same month.",

The auto index gained 1.24% and was the top sectoral gainer by percentage.Mahindra & Mahindra climbed 3.27% after reporting a 25% jump in October car sales to dealers, helped by festive demand. It was the top Nifty 50 gainer as well.The broader, more domestically focussed mid and small-caps rose about 0.7% and 1%, respectively.\"Despite the recent fall in the markets, the optimism during the muhurat trading signifies positive investor sentiment,\" said Vikas Gupta, chief executive at OmniScience Capital.While the recent correction has made segments in domestic markets attractive in terms of valuations, the near-term trajectory will depend on the U.S. non-farm payrolls data on Friday and U.S. presidential elections next week besides domestic corporate earnings and foreign outflows, two analysts said.Among individual stocks, construction company NCC gained 4.60% after securing orders worth 34.96 billion rupees in the previous month.Hospital-chain operator Narayana Hrudayalaya fell 2% on posting a lower quarterly profit.",

        "text": "(Bloomberg) -- As investors grow worried about Brazil\u2019s fiscal outlook, selling off the real and betting on even bigger interest rate hikes, the central bank has started to signal that budget concerns are exaggerated.\n\nThe finance ministry and the monetary authority share the view that a much\u2014anticipated plan to cut public spending will shore up investors\u2019 confidence in Brazil\u2019s fiscal rules and alleviate pressure for a more aggressive tightening campaign, according to a member of President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\u2019s economic team.\n\nAnd while fiscal woes exist, they\u2019re not big enough to justify an interest rate increase of 75 basis points that traders threatened to price in last week, the person said, requesting anonymity to discuss the thinking of the economic team.\n\nBrazil\u2019s central bank kicked off a monetary tightening campaign in September to fight inflation that\u2019s speeding up above the 3% target \u2014 largely because government spending is making consumer demand more resilient. The bank is widely expected to step up the pace next week, delivering a half-point increase that would take the benchmark Selic to 11.25%, after an initial quarter-point hike.\n\nYet central bank board members have adopted a more nuanced rhetoric about fiscal concerns. After months of warnings about the importance of delivering on fiscal pledges, policymakers are now saying that the risk premium priced into Brazilian assets is exaggerated and likely to be reversed by a positive fiscal shock. Governor Roberto Campos Neto went as far as telling investors to wait for good news on spending cuts following October\u2019s municipal elections.\n\n\u201cThe central bank is making an effort to give a vote of confidence to the finance ministry,\u201d said Guilherme Abbud, the CEO of Persevera Asset Management in Sao Paulo.\n\nLula has increased spending since taking office in 2023 to fulfill campaign pledges of improving living standards for poor Brazilians. Public coffers have come under additional pressure this year as the administration responds to disasters including historic floods in May, followed by widespread forest fires and record drought.\n\nThe message that Finance Minister Fernando Haddad is now conveying to Lula is that the government needs to rein in mandatory spending in coming months, said a person familiar with the minister\u2019s thinking. The growth of some of those expenditures beyond the limit allowed by fiscal rules - 2.5% above inflation - will only create more pressure on the budget and spur public debt as time goes by.\n\nRegardless, Brazil\u2019s central bank will keep its guard up. Economic Policy Director Diogo Guillen said in Washington, during the meeting of the International Monetary Fund last week, that board members won\u2019t be passive, and the role of monetary policy is to bring inflation back to target.\n\nGuillen also presented a study on the impacts of government transfers equivalent to 1% of gross domestic product. His conclusion was that, even if fiscal policy doesn\u2019t boost economic growth, it can still be inflationary.\n\nPlanning Minister Simone Tebet said this month the government will unveil \u201cas many measures as possible\u201d to cut spending this year. One proposal alone could save some 20 billion reais ($3.5 billion), she said, without providing details.\n\nSpending that\u2019s mandated by the constitution accounts for 90% of total government outlays. Brazil will end 2024 with a 68.8 billion-real primary fiscal deficit, which excludes interest payments, according to a budget report released in September.\n\nFor 2025, the government plans to eliminate that gap with the help of 166.4 billion reais in extraordinary revenue. The administration had previously backed off its pledge for a surplus next year, sparking a wave of investor angst.\n\n--With assistance from Barbara Nascimento.\n\nMore stories like this are available on bloomberg.com",

        "text": "Nov 1 (Reuters) - Prominent proxy advisory firm Institutional Shareholder Services on Friday recommended Frontier Communications shareholders abstain from voting on Verizon's $20 billion takeover bid and instead support the adjournment proposal.\n\nShareholders must decide whether a sale to Verizon, which likely would not close for at least another year, represents a better risk-adjusted alternative to the company's standalone option, the proxy advisory firm said in a report.\n\n\"Given the possibility of substantially more value down the line, and the lack of urgency to approve a transaction ... it seems reasonable for shareholders to exercise the optionality of abstaining for the time being,\" ISS said.\n\nVerizon said in September it would buy Frontier at an offer price of $38.50 per share, as the U.S. telecom giant looks to build its fiber subscriber base and better compete with rivals such as AT&T.\n\nThe takeover, however, has faced opposition from some Frontier shareholders. Reuters first reported last month that some of the fiber-optic internet provider's largest shareholders were concerned about the deal.\n\nGlendon Capital Management, which owns nearly 10% of Frontier, said last month it had decided to vote against the deal at the current price, as it \"significantly undervalues\" Frontier's assets and earnings trajectory.\n\nISS said the firm finds it unlikely that Verizon would \"dramatically raise its bid for Frontier at this stage.\"\n\nLast week, Frontier urged its shareholders to vote for the proposal, saying that it had reviewed interest from other potential buyers and found Verizon's proposal as the most favorable option.",

        "text": "NEW YORK (AP) \u2014 New York City Mayor Eric Adams returned to court Friday as he seeks to fend off federal corruption charges while battling for his political future.\n\nThe Democrat is appearing at the 2 p.m. hearing in Manhattan federal court, where his lawyers are set to argue that a bribery charge \u2014 one of five counts against Adams \u2014 should be thrown out because it does not meet the federal standard of a crime.\n\nThe indictment, which also includes wire fraud and conspiracy charges, accuses Adams of accepting flight upgrades and other luxury travel perks valued at $100,000 along with illegal campaign contributions from a Turkish official and other foreign nationals looking to buy his influence.\n\nIn exchange, prosecutors say, Adams performed political favors that benefited the Turkish government, including accelerating the opening of a consulate building deemed unsafe by fire inspectors.\n\nAdams has pleaded not guilty to the charges and vowed to remain in office as he mounts his legal defense.\n\nU.S. District Judge Dale E. Ho allotted the defense and prosecution each 20 minutes to argue the issue.\n\nLate Thursday, Ho rejected Adams' request for a hearing on the mayor's claims that the government has been leaking information about the investigation to the news media. The judge ruled that Adams and his lawyers failed to substantiate those claims and, if any leaks occurred, that the government was to blame.\n\nAs for the bribery charge, Adams\u2019 lawyers urged Ho in a memo last month to dismiss the \u201cextraordinarily vague\u201d allegation, saying it sought to criminalize \u201cnormal and perfectly lawful acts\u201d that Adams undertook as Brooklyn borough president before he was elected mayor.\n\nThe years of flight upgrades and other perks he received were at most \u201cclassic gratuities,\u201d which a recent U.S. Supreme Court rulings found were not covered by the bribery statute if they were given for past acts, according to the filing.\n\nFederal prosecutors, meanwhile, responded that Adams actions were plainly criminal.\n\n\u201cIt should be clear from the face of the indictment that there is nothing routine about a public official accepting over $100,000 in benefits from a foreign diplomat, which he took great pains to conceal \u2014 including by manufacturing fake paper trails to create the illusion of payment,\u201d prosecutors wrote.\n\nHo is expected to hear arguments from each side on the motion to toss the charge. It\u2019s unclear when he will issue his decision.\n\nAt a hearing last month, federal prosecutors indicated they may bring additional charges against Adams and indict others around him.\n\nSeveral of Adams\u2019 closest aides \u2014 including his police commissioner, schools chancellor and multiple deputy mayors \u2014 have resigned in recent months after federal investigators executed coordinated searches of their homes in early September.\n\nAdams has maintained that he can continue to lead the city effectively while fighting the charges.\n\nBut his political future remains fraught and several opponents have announced plans to challenge him in next year's mayoral primary.",
